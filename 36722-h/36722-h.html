[Transcriber's Note: This book contains much Greek text, which will not be
well-rendered in plain text versions of this E-book. Also, there is much use of
Greek characters with a vertical bar across the tops of the letters to indicate
abbreviations; because the coding system used in this e-book does not have such an
<span class="tei tei-q">“overline”</span>, they are rendered here with underlines. It also contains some text
in Syriac, which is written right-to-left; for the sake of different transcription
methods, it is transcribed here in both right-to-left and left-to-rights, so that
regardless of the medium of this E-book, one or the other should be readable.]

Volume to yourself; but for whom—(I reserve the explanation
for another day)—it would never have been written.</span></span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">This is not, (as you will perceive at a glance,) the Treatise
which a few years ago I told you I had in hand; and which,
but for the present hindrance, might by this time have been
completed. It has however</span></span> grown out <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">of that other work in
the manner explained at the beginning of my Preface. Moreover
it contains not a few specimens of the argumentation of
which the work in question, when at last it sees the light, will
be discovered to be full.</span></span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">My one object has been to defeat the mischievous attempt
which was made in 1881 to thrust upon this Church and
Realm a Revision of the Sacred Text, which—recommended
though it be by eminent names—I am thoroughly convinced,
and am able to prove, is untrustworthy from beginning to end.</span></span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The reason is plain. It has been constructed throughout on
an utterly erroneous hypothesis. And I inscribe this Volume
to you, my friend, as a conspicuous member of that body of
faithful and learned Laity by whose deliberate verdict, when
the whole of the evidence has been produced and the case
has been fully argued out, I shall be quite willing that my
contention may stand or fall.</span></span>

how a company of Scholars can have spent ten years in
elaborating such a very unsatisfactory production. Their
uncouth phraseology and their jerky sentences, their pedantic

the felicities of the rhythm</span><span style="font-style: italic">”</span></span><span style="font-style: italic"> of our Authorized Version. The
transition from one to the other, as the Bishop of Lincoln
remarks, is like exchanging a well-built carriage for a vehicle
without springs, in which you get jolted to death on a newly-mended
and rarely-traversed road. But the </span><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-style: italic">“</span><span style="font-style: italic">Revised Version</span><span style="font-style: italic">”</span></span><span style="font-style: italic">

mean, in countless places.</span></span>

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">It is, however, the</span></span> systematic depravation of the underlying
Greek <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">which does so grievously offend me: for this is nothing
else but a poisoning of the River of Life at its sacred source.
Our Revisers, (with the best and purest intentions, no doubt,)
stand convicted of having deliberately rejected the words of

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">As Critics they have had abundant warning. Twelve years
ago (1871) a volume appeared on</span></span> the <span class="tei tei-q">“last Twelve Verses of
the Gospel according to S. Mark,”</span>—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">of which the declared
object was to vindicate those Verses against certain critical
objectors, and to establish them by an exhaustive argumentative
process. Up to this hour, for a very obvious reason, no answer
to that volume has been attempted. And yet, at the end of ten
years (1881),—not only in the Revised English but also in the
volume which professes to exhibit the underlying Greek, (which
at least is indefensible,)—the Revisers are observed to separate
off those Twelve precious Verses from their context, in token that
they are no part of the genuine Gospel. Such a deliberate preference
of</span></span> <span class="tei tei-q">“mumpsimus”</span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">to</span></span> <span class="tei tei-q">“sumpsimus”</span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">is by no means calculated
to conciliate favour, or even to win respect. The Revisers
have in fact been the dupes of an ingenious Theorist, concerning
whose extraordinary views you are invited to read what Dr.
Scrivener has recently put forth. The words of the last-named
writer (who is</span></span> facile princeps <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">in Textual Criticism) will be

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The ensuing three Articles from the <span class="tei tei-q">“Quarterly Review,”</span>—(wrung
out of me by the publication [May 17th, 1881]
of the <span class="tei tei-q">“Revision”</span> of our <span class="tei tei-q">“Authorized Version of the New
Testament,”</span>)—appear in their present form in compliance
with an amount of continuous solicitation that they should
be separately published, which it would have been alike unreasonable
and ungracious to disregard. I was not prepared
for it. It has caused me—as letter after letter has reached
my hands—mixed feelings; has revived all my original
disinclination and regret. For, gratified as I cannot but feel
by the reception my labours have met with,—(and only the
Author of my being knows what an amount of antecedent
toil is represented by the ensuing pages,)—I yet deplore
more heartily than I am able to express, the injustice done
to the cause of Truth by handling the subject in this fragmentary
way, and by exhibiting the evidence for what is
most certainly true, in such a very incomplete form. A
systematic Treatise is the indispensable condition for securing
cordial assent to the view for which I mainly contend. The
cogency of the argument lies entirely in the cumulative
character of the proof. It requires to be demonstrated by
induction from a large collection of particular instances, as
well as by the complex exhibition of many converging lines
of evidence, that the testimony of one small group of
documents, or rather, of one particular manuscript,—(namely
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagex">[pg x]</span><a name="Pgx" id="Pgx" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the Vatican Codex <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b</span></span>, which, for some unexplained reason, it
is just now the fashion to regard with superstitious deference,)—is
the reverse of trustworthy. Nothing in fact but a
considerable Treatise will ever effectually break the yoke of
that iron tyranny to which the excellent Bishop of Gloucester
and Bristol and his colleagues have recently bowed their
necks; and are now for imposing on all English-speaking
men. In brief, if I were not, on the one hand, thoroughly
convinced of the strength of my position,—(and I know it
to be absolutely impregnable);—yet more, if on the other
hand, I did not cherish entire confidence in the practical
good sense and fairness of the English mind;—I could
not have brought myself to come before the public in the
unsystematic way which alone is possible in the pages of
a Review. I must have waited, at all hazards, till I had
finished <span class="tei tei-q">“my Book.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But then, delay would have been fatal. I saw plainly
that unless a sharp blow was delivered immediately, the
Citadel would be in the enemy's hands. I knew also that it
was just possible to condense into 60 or 70 closely-printed
pages what must <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">logically</span></em> prove fatal to the <span class="tei tei-q">“Revision.”</span> So
I set to work; and during the long summer days of 1881
(June to September) the foremost of these three Articles was
elaborated. When the October number of <span class="tei tei-q">“the Quarterly”</span>
appeared, I comforted myself with the secret consciousness
that enough was by this time on record, even had my life
been suddenly brought to a close, to secure the ultimate rejection
of the <span class="tei tei-q">“Revision”</span> of 1881. I knew that the <span class="tei tei-q">“New
Greek Text,”</span> (and therefore the <span class="tei tei-q">“New English Version”</span>),
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexi">[pg xi]</span><a name="Pgxi" id="Pgxi" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
had received its death-blow. It might for a few years drag
out a maimed existence; eagerly defended by some,—timidly
pleaded for by others. But such efforts could be of no avail.
Its days were already numbered. The effect of more and
yet more learned investigation,—of more elaborate and more
extended inquiry,—<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">must</span></em> be to convince mankind more and
yet more thoroughly that the principles on which it had been
constructed were radically unsound. In the end, when partisanship
had cooled down, and passion had evaporated, and
prejudice had ceased to find an auditory, the <span class="tei tei-q">“Revision”</span> of
1881 must come to be universally regarded as—what it most
certainly is,—<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the most astonishing, as well as the most calamitous
literary blunder of the Age</span></em>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I. I pointed out that <span class="tei tei-q">“the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">New Greek Text</span></span>,”</span>—which, in
defiance of their instructions,<a id="noteref_1" name="noteref_1" href="#note_1"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1</span></span></a> the Revisionists of <span class="tei tei-q">“the
Authorized English Version”</span> had been so ill-advised as to
spend ten years in elaborating,—was a wholly untrustworthy
performance: was full of the gravest errors from beginning
to end: had been constructed throughout on an entirely
mistaken Theory. Availing myself of the published confession
of one of the Revisionists,<a id="noteref_2" name="noteref_2" href="#note_2"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2</span></span></a> I explained the nature of
the calamity which had befallen the Revision. I traced the
mischief home to its true authors,—Drs. Westcott and Hort;
a copy of whose unpublished Text of the N. T. (the most
vicious in existence) had been confidentially, and under
pledges of the strictest secrecy, placed in the hands of every
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexii">[pg xii]</span><a name="Pgxii" id="Pgxii" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
member of the revising Body.<a id="noteref_3" name="noteref_3" href="#note_3"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3</span></span></a> I called attention to the
fact that, unacquainted with the difficult and delicate science
of Textual Criticism, the Revisionists had, in an evil hour,
surrendered themselves to Dr. Hort's guidance: had preferred
his counsels to those of Prebendary Scrivener, (an infinitely
more trustworthy guide): and that the work before the
public was the piteous—but <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">inevitable</span></em>—result. All this I
explained in the October number of the <span class="tei tei-q">“Quarterly Review”</span>
for 1881.<a id="noteref_4" name="noteref_4" href="#note_4"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">4</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
II. In thus demonstrating the worthlessness of the <span class="tei tei-q">“New
Greek Text”</span> of the Revisionists, I considered that I had
destroyed the key of their position. And so perforce I
had: for if the underlying Greek Text be mistaken, what
else but incorrect must the English Translation be? But on
examining the so-called <span class="tei tei-q">“Revision of the Authorized Version,”</span>
I speedily made the further discovery that the Revised
English would have been in itself intolerable, even had the
Greek been let alone. In the first place, to my surprise and
annoyance, it proved to be a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">New Translation</span></em> (rather than a
Revision of the Old) which had been attempted. Painfully
apparent were the tokens which met me on every side
that the Revisionists had been supremely eager not so much
to correct none but <span class="tei tei-q">“plain and clear errors,”</span>—as to introduce
as many changes into the English of the New Testament
Scriptures as they conveniently could.<a id="noteref_5" name="noteref_5" href="#note_5"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">5</span></span></a> A skittish impatience
of the admirable work before them, and a strange inability
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexiii">[pg xiii]</span><a name="Pgxiii" id="Pgxiii" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
to appreciate its manifold excellences:—a singular imagination
on the part of the promiscuous Company which met in
the Jerusalem Chamber that they were competent to improve
the Authorized Version in every part, and an unaccountable
forgetfulness that the fundamental condition under which
the task of Revision had been by themselves undertaken,
was that they should abstain from all but <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">necessary</span></em>”</span>
changes:—<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">this</span></em> proved to be only part of the offence which
the Revisionists had committed. It was found that they had
erred through <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">defective Scholarship</span></em> to an extent, and with a
frequency, which to me is simply inexplicable. I accordingly
made it my business to demonstrate all this in a second
Article which appeared in the next (the January) number
of the <span class="tei tei-q">“Quarterly Review,”</span> and was entitled <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">The New
English Translation</span></span>.”</span><a id="noteref_6" name="noteref_6" href="#note_6"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">6</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
III. Thereupon, a pretence was set up in many quarters,
(<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">but only by the Revisionists and their friends</span></em>,) that all my
labour hitherto had been thrown away, because I had omitted
to disprove the principles on which this <span class="tei tei-q">“New Greek Text”</span>
is founded. I flattered myself indeed that quite enough had
been said to make it logically certain that the underlying
<span class="tei tei-q">“Textual Theory”</span> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">must be</span></em> worthless. But I was not suffered
to cherish this conviction in quiet. It was again and again
cast in my teeth that I had not yet grappled with Drs. Westcott
and Hort's <span class="tei tei-q">“arguments.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Instead of condemning <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">their
Text</span></em>, why do you not disprove <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">their Theory</span></em>?”</span> It was tauntingly
insinuated that I knew better than to cross swords
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexiv">[pg xiv]</span><a name="Pgxiv" id="Pgxiv" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
with the two Cambridge Professors. This reduced me to the
necessity of either leaving it to be inferred from my silence
that I had found Drs. Westcott and Hort's <span class="tei tei-q">“arguments”</span>
unanswerable; or else of coming forward with their book in
my hand, and demonstrating that in their solemn pages an
attentive reader finds himself encountered by nothing but a
series of unsupported assumptions: that their (so called)
<span class="tei tei-q">“Theory”</span> is in reality nothing else but a weak effort of the
Imagination: that the tissue which these accomplished
scholars have been thirty years in elaborating, proves on
inspection to be as flimsy and as worthless as any spider's
web.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I made it my business in consequence to expose, somewhat
in detail, (in a third Article, which appeared in the
<span class="tei tei-q">“Quarterly Review”</span> for April 1882), the absolute absurdity,—(I
use the word advisedly)—of <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Westcott and Hort's
New Textual Theory</span></span>;”</span><a id="noteref_7" name="noteref_7" href="#note_7"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">7</span></span></a> and I now respectfully commend
those 130 pages to the attention of candid and unprejudiced
readers. It were idle to expect to convince any others. We
have it on good authority (Dr. Westcott's) that <span class="tei tei-q">“he who has
long pondered over a train of Reasoning, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">becomes unable to
detect its weak points</span></em>.”</span><a id="noteref_8" name="noteref_8" href="#note_8"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">8</span></span></a> A yet stranger phenomenon is, that
those who have once committed themselves to an erroneous
Theory, seem to be incapable of opening their eyes to the
untrustworthiness of the fabric they have erected, even when
it comes down in their sight, like a child's house built with
playing-cards,—and presents to every eye but their own the
appearance of a shapeless ruin.

§ 1. Two full years have elapsed since the first of these
Essays was published; and my Criticism—for the best of
reasons—remains to this hour unanswered. The public
has been assured indeed, (in the course of some hysterical
remarks by Canon Farrar<a id="noteref_9" name="noteref_9" href="#note_9"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">9</span></span></a>), that <span class="tei tei-q">“the <span class="tei tei-q">‘Quarterly Reviewer’</span>
can be refuted as fully as he desires as soon as any scholar
has the leisure to answer him.”</span> The <span class="tei tei-q">“Quarterly Reviewer”</span>
can afford to wait,—if the Revisers can. But they are
reminded that it is no answer to one who has demolished
their master's <span class="tei tei-q">“Theory,”</span> for the pupils to keep on reproducing
fragments of it; and by their mistakes and exaggerations, to
make both themselves and him, ridiculous.

encouraging estimate of my labours, I gladly record my
conviction that if he will seriously apply his powerful and
accurate mind to the department of Textual Criticism, he
will probably produce a work which will help materially to
establish the study in which he takes such an intelligent
interest, on a scientific basis. But then, he is invited to
accept the friendly assurance that the indispensable condition
of success in this department is, that a man should give
to the subject, (which is a very intricate one and abounds in
unexplored problems), his undivided attention for an extended
period. I trust there is nothing unreasonable in the suggestion
that one who has not done this, should be very circumspect
when he sits in judgment on a neighbour of his who, for
very many years past, has given to Textual Criticism the
whole of his time;—has freely sacrificed health, ease, relaxation,
even necessary rest, to this one object;—has made
it his one business to acquire such an independent mastery

§ 6. But how (let me ask) does it appear from this, that
I have <span class="tei tei-q">“put forth Lloyd's Greek Testament as the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">final
standard of Appeal</span></em>”</span>? True, that, in order to exhibit clearly
their respective divergences, I have referred five famous
codices (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a b</span></span> א <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">c d</span></span>)—certain of which are found to have
turned the brain of Critics of the new school—<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">to one and the
same familiar exhibition of the commonly received Text of the
New Testament</span></em>: but by so doing I have not by any means
assumed <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the Textual purity</span></em> of that common standard. In
other words I have not made it <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the final standard of
Appeal</span></em>.”</span> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">All</span></em> Critics,—wherever found,—at all times, have
collated with the commonly received Text: but only as the
most convenient <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">standard of Comparison</span></em>; not, surely, as the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexix">[pg xix]</span><a name="Pgxix" id="Pgxix" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
absolute <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">standard of Excellence</span></em>. The result of the experiment
already referred to,—(and, I beg to say, it was an exceedingly
laborious experiment,)—has been, to demonstrate that
the five Manuscripts in question stand apart from one another
in the following proportions:—
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
842 (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a</span></span>) : 1798 (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">c</span></span>) : 2370 (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b</span></span>) : 3392 (א) : 4697 (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">d</span></span>).
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But would not the same result have been obtained if the
<span class="tei tei-q">“five old uncials”</span> had been <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">referred to any other common
standard which can be named</span></em>? In the meantime, what else
is the inevitable inference from this phenomenon but that
four out of the five <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">must</span></em> be—while all the five <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">may</span></em> be—outrageously
depraved documents? instead of being fit to be
made our exclusive guides to the Truth of Scripture,—as
Critics of the school of Tischendorf and Tregelles would have
us believe that they are?

which appeared in April 1882, remains to be considered.
Written expressly in defence of the Revisers and their New
Greek Text, this composition displays a slenderness of
acquaintance with the subject now under discussion, for
which I was little prepared. Inasmuch however as it is the
production of the Chairman of the Revisionist body, and
professes to be a reply to my first two Articles, I have
bestowed upon it an elaborate and particular rejoinder
extending to an hundred-and-fifty pages.<a id="noteref_16" name="noteref_16" href="#note_16"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">16</span></span></a> I shall in

§ 9. The respected writer does nothing else but reproduce
Westcott and Hort's theory <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in Westcott and Hort's words</span></em>.
He contributes nothing of his own. The singular infelicity
which attended his complaint that the <span class="tei tei-q">“Quarterly Reviewer”</span>
<span class="tei tei-q">“censures their [Westcott and Hort's] Text,”</span> but, <span class="tei tei-q">“has not
attempted <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">a serious examination of the arguments which they

The rest of the Bishop's contention may be summed
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexxi">[pg xxi]</span><a name="Pgxxi" id="Pgxxi" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
up in two propositions:—The first, (I.) That if the Revisionists
are wrong in their <span class="tei tei-q">“New Greek Text,”</span> then (not only
Westcott and Hort, but) Lachmann, Tischendorf and Tregelles
must be wrong also,—a statement which I hold to be incontrovertible.—The
Bishop's other position is also undeniable:
viz. (II.) That in order to pass an equitable judgment on
ancient documents, they are to be carefully studied, closely
compared, and tested by a more scientific process than rough
comparison with the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Textus Receptus</span></span>.<a id="noteref_18" name="noteref_18" href="#note_18"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">18</span></span></a>... Thus, on both
heads, I find myself entirely at one with Bp. Ellicott.

for discussion. Thus,

§ 11. At page 64 of his pamphlet, he fastens resolutely
upon the famous problem whether <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">God</span></span>”</span> (Θεός), or <span class="tei tei-q">“who”</span>
(ὅς), is to be read in 1 Timothy iii. 16. I had upheld
the former reading in eight pages. He contends for the
latter, with something like acrimony, in twelve.<a id="noteref_19" name="noteref_19" href="#note_19"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">19</span></span></a> I have
been at the pains, in consequence, to write a <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Dissertation</span></span>”</span>
of seventy-six pages on this important subject,<a id="noteref_20" name="noteref_20" href="#note_20"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">20</span></span></a>—the preparation
of which (may I be allowed to record the circumstance

me severely. Thus, the only point which Bishop Ellicott
has condescended to discuss argumentatively with me, will
be found to enjoy full half of my letter to him in reply.

The <span class="tei tei-q">“Dissertation”</span> referred to, I submit with humble confidence
to the judgment of educated Englishmen. It requires
no learning to understand the case. And I have particularly
to request that those who will be at the pains to look into
this question, will remember,—(1) That the place of Scripture
discussed (viz. 1 Tim. iii. 16) was deliberately selected
for a trial of strength by the Bishop: (I should not have
chosen it myself):—(2) That on the issue of the contention
which he has thus himself invited, we have respectively
staked our critical reputation. The discussion exhibits very
fairly our two methods,—his and mine; and <span class="tei tei-q">“is of great
importance as an example,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“illustrating in a striking
manner”</span> our respective positions,—as the Bishop himself
has been careful to remind his readers.<a id="noteref_22" name="noteref_22" href="#note_22"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">22</span></span></a>

§ 12. One merely desirous of taking a general survey of
this question, is invited to read from page <a href="#Pg485" class="tei tei-ref">485</a> to 496 of the

§ 13. A thoughtful person who has been at the pains to do
this, will be apt on laying down the book to ask,—<span class="tei tei-q">“But is
it not very remarkable that so many as five of the ancient
Versions should favour the reading <span class="tei tei-q">‘which,’</span> (μυστήριον; ὃ
ἐφανερώθη,) instead of <span class="tei tei-q">‘<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">God</span></span>’</span> (Θεός)”</span>?—<span class="tei tei-q">“Yes, it is very
remarkable,”</span> I answer. <span class="tei tei-q">“For though the Old Latin and the
two Egyptian Versions are constantly observed to conspire
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexxiii">[pg xxiii]</span><a name="Pgxxiii" id="Pgxxiii" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
in error, they rarely find allies in the Peschito and the
Æthiopic. On the other hand, you are to remember that
besides <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Versions</span></span>, the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Fathers</span></span> have to be inquired after:
while more important than either is the testimony of the
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Copies</span></span>. Now, the combined witness to <span class="tei tei-q">‘<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">God</span></span>’</span> (Θεός),—so
multitudinous, so respectable, so varied, so unequivocal,—of
the Copies and of the Fathers (in addition to three of the
Versions) is simply overwhelming. It becomes undeniable
that Θεός is by far the best supported reading of the present
place.”</span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
§ 14. When, however, such an one as Tischendorf or
Tregelles,—Hort or Ellicott,—would put me down by reminding
me that half-a-dozen of the oldest Versions are
against me,—<span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">That</span></em> argument”</span> (I reply) <span class="tei tei-q">“is not allowable
on <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">your</span></em> lips. For if the united testimony of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">five</span></em> of the
Versions really be, in your account, decisive,—Why do you
deny the genuineness of the last Twelve Verses of S. Mark's
Gospel, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">which are recognized by every one of the Versions</span></em>?
Those Verses are besides attested <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">by every known Copy</span></em>, except
two of bad character: <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">by a mighty chorus of Fathers</span></em>: <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">by the
unfaltering Tradition of the Church universal</span></em>. First remove
from S. Mark xvi. 20, your brand of suspicion, and then
come back to me in order that we may discuss together how
1 Tim. iii. 16 is to be read. And yet, when you come back,
it must not be to plead in favour of <span class="tei tei-q">‘who’</span> (ὅσ), in place of
<span class="tei tei-q">‘<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">God</span></span>’</span> (Θεός). For <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">not</span></em> <span class="tei tei-q">‘who’</span> (ὅς), remember, but <span class="tei tei-q">‘which’</span> (ὅ)
is the reading advocated by those five earliest Versions.”</span> ...
In other words,—the reading of 1 Tim. iii. 16, which the
Revisers have adopted, enjoys, (as I have shown from page
<a href="#Pg428" class="tei tei-ref">428</a> to page 501), <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the feeblest attestation of any</span></em>; besides
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexxiv">[pg xxiv]</span><a name="Pgxxiv" id="Pgxxiv" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
being condemned by internal considerations and the universal
Tradition of the Eastern Church.

§ 15. I pass on, after modestly asking,—Is it too much to
hope, (I covet no other guerdon for my labour!) that we
shall hear no more about substituting <span class="tei tei-q">“who”</span> for <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">God</span></span>”</span> in
1 Tim. iii. 16? We may not go on disputing for ever: and
surely, until men are able to produce some more cogent
evidence than has yet come to light in support of <span class="tei tei-q">“the
mystery of godliness, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">who</span></em>”</span> (τὸ τῆς εὐσβείας μυστήριον:
ὅς),—all sincere inquirers after Truth are bound to accept
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">that</span></em> reading which has been demonstrated to be by far the
best attested. Enough however on this head.

§ 16. It was said just now that I cordially concur with
Bp. Ellicott in the second of his two propositions,—viz. That
<span class="tei tei-q">“no equitable judgment can be passed on ancient documents
until they are carefully studied, and closely compared with
each other, and tested by a more scientific process than rough
comparison with”</span> the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Textus Receptus</span></span>. I wish to add a few
words on this subject: the rather, because what I am about
to say will be found as applicable to my Reviewer in the
<span class="tei tei-q">“Church Quarterly”</span> as to the Bishop. Both have misapprehended
this matter, and in exactly the same way. Where
such accomplished Scholars have erred, what wonder if
ordinary readers should find themselves all a-field?

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
§ 17. In Textual Criticism then, <span class="tei tei-q">“rough comparison”</span> can
seldom, if ever, be of any real use. On the other hand, the
exact <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Collation</span></em> of documents whether ancient or modern with
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexxv">[pg xxv]</span><a name="Pgxxv" id="Pgxxv" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the received Text, is the necessary foundation of all scientific
Criticism. I employ that Text,—(as Mill, Bentley, Wetstein;
Griesbach, Matthæi, Scholz; Tischendorf, Tregelles, Scrivener,
employed it before me,)—not as a criterion of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Excellence</span></em>, but
as a standard of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Comparison</span></em>. All this will be found fully
explained below, from page <a href="#Pg383" class="tei tei-ref">383</a> to page 391. Whenever I
would judge of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the authenticity</span></em> of any particular reading, I
insist on bringing it, wherever found,—whether in Justin
Martyr and Irenæus, on the one hand; or in Stephens and
Elzevir, on the other;—to the test of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Catholic Antiquity</span></em>. If
that witness is consentient, or very nearly so, whether for or
against any given reading, I hold it to be decisive. To no
other system of arbitration will I submit myself. I decline
to recognise any other criterion of Truth.

§ 18. What compels me to repeat this so often, is the
impatient self-sufficiency of these last days, which is for
breaking away from the old restraints; and for erecting the
individual conscience into an authority from which there
shall be no appeal. I know but too well how laborious is
the scientific method which <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">I</span></em> advocate. A long summer day
disappears, while the student—with all his appliances about
him—is resolutely threshing out some minute textual problem.
Another, and yet another bright day vanishes. Comes Saturday
evening at last, and a page of illegible manuscript is all that
he has to show for a week's heavy toil. <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Quousque tandem?</span></span>
And yet, it is the indispensable condition of progress in an
unexplored region, that a few should thus labour, until a
path has been cut through the forest,—a road laid down,—huts
built,—a <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">modus vivendi</span></span> established. In this department
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexxvi">[pg xxvi]</span><a name="Pgxxvi" id="Pgxxvi" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of sacred Science, men have been going on too long inventing
their facts, and delivering themselves of oracular decrees, on
the sole responsibility of their own inner consciousness.
There is great convenience in such a method certainly,—a
charming simplicity which is in a high degree attractive to
flesh and blood. It dispenses with proof. It furnishes no
evidence. It asserts when it ought to argue.<a id="noteref_23" name="noteref_23" href="#note_23"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">23</span></span></a> It reiterates

This,—which I venture to style the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">unscientific</span></em> method,—reached
its culminating point when Professors Westcott and
Hort recently put forth their Recension of the Greek Text.
Their work is indeed quite a psychological curiosity.
Incomprehensible to me is it how two able men of
disciplined understandings can have seriously put forth
the volume which they call <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Introduction</span></span>—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Appendix</span></span>.”</span>
It is the very <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Reductio ad absurdum</span></span> of the uncritical
method of the last fifty years. And it is especially in
opposition to this new method of theirs that I so strenuously
insist that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the consentient voice of Catholic Antiquity</span></em> is to be
diligently inquired after and submissively listened to; for
that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">this</span></em>, in the end, will prove our <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">only</span></em> safe guide.

<span class="tei tei-q">“Theory.”</span> My <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">method</span></em> I have explained often and fully enough.
My business was to prove that the theory of Drs. Westcott
and Hort,—which (as Bp. Ellicott's pamphlet proves) has
been mainly adopted by the Revisionists,—is not only a
worthless, but an utterly absurd one. And I have proved
it. The method I persistently advocate in every case of a
supposed doubtful Reading, (I say it for the last time, and
request that I may be no more misrepresented,) is, that
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">an appeal shall be unreservedly made to Catholic Antiquity</span></em>;
and that the combined verdict of Manuscripts, Versions,

§ 20. I find myself, in the mean time, met by the scoffs,
jeers, misrepresentations of the disciples of this new School;
who, instead of producing historical facts and intelligible
arguments, appeal to the decrees of their teachers,—which <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">I</span></em>
disallow, and which <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">they</span></em> are unable to substantiate. They
delight in announcing that Textual Criticism made <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">a fresh
departure</span></em>”</span> with the edition of Drs. Westcott and Hort: that
the work of those scholars <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">marks an era</span></em>,”</span> and is spoken of
in Germany as <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">epoch-making</span></em>.”</span> My own belief is, that the
Edition in question, if it be epoch-making at all, marks <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">that</span></em>
epoch at which the current of critical thought, reversing
its wayward course, began once more to flow in its ancient
healthy channel. <span class="tei tei-q">“Cloud-land”</span> having been duly sighted on
the 14th September 1881,<a id="noteref_26" name="noteref_26" href="#note_26"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">26</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-q">“a fresh departure”</span> was insisted
upon by public opinion,—and a deliberate return was made,—to
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">terra firma</span></span>, and <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">terra cognita</span></span>, and common sense. So
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexxviii">[pg xxviii]</span><a name="Pgxxviii" id="Pgxxviii" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
far from <span class="tei tei-q">“its paramount claim to the respect of future
generations,”</span> being <span class="tei tei-q">“the restitution of a more ancient and
a purer Text,”</span>—I venture to predict that the edition of the
two Cambridge Professors will be hereafter remembered as
indicating the furthest point ever reached by the self-evolved
imaginations of English disciples of the school of Lachmann,
Tischendorf, Tregelles. The recoil promises to be complete.
English good sense is ever observed to prevail in the long
run; although for a few years a foreign fashion may acquire
the ascendant, and beguile a few unstable wits.

§ 21. It only remains to state that in republishing these
Essays I have availed myself of the opportunity to make
several corrections and additions; as well as here and there
to expand what before had been too briefly delivered. My
learned friend and kind neighbour, the Rev. R. Cowley
Powles, has ably helped me to correct the sheets. Much
valuable assistance has been zealously rendered me throughout
by my nephew, the Rev. William F. Rose, Vicar of
Worle, Somersetshire. But the unwearied patience and consummate
skill of my Secretary (M. W.) passes praise. Every
syllable of the present volume has been transcribed by her
for the press; and to her I am indebted for two of my Indices.—The
obligations under which many learned men, both
at home and abroad, have laid me, will be found faithfully
acknowledged, in the proper place, at the foot of the page. I
am sincerely grateful to them all.

§ 22. It will be readily believed that I have been sorely
tempted to recast the whole and to strengthen my position
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexxix">[pg xxix]</span><a name="Pgxxix" id="Pgxxix" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
in every part: but then, the work would have no longer been,—<span class="tei tei-q">“Three
Articles reprinted from the Quarterly Review.”</span>
Earnestly have I desired, for many years past, to produce
a systematic Treatise on this great subject. My aspiration
all along has been, and still is, in place of the absolute
Empiricism which has hitherto prevailed in Textual inquiry
to exhibit the logical outlines of what, I am persuaded, is
destined to become a truly delightful Science. But I more
than long,—I fairly <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ache</span></em> to have done with Controversy, and
to be free to devote myself to the work of Interpretation.
My apology for bestowing so large a portion of my time on
Textual Criticism, is David's when he was reproached by his
brethren for appearing on the field of battle,—<span class="tei tei-q">“Is there not

§ 23. For,—let it clearly be noted,—it is no longer the
case that critical doubts concerning the sacred Text are
confined to critical Editions of the Greek. So long as scholars
were content to ventilate their crotchets in a little arena of
their own,—however mistaken they might be, and even
though they changed their opinions once in every ten years,—no
great harm was likely to come of it. Students of the
Greek Testament were sure to have their attention called
to the subject,—which must always be in the highest degree
desirable; and it was to be expected that in this, as in every
other department of learning, the progress of Inquiry would
result in gradual accessions of certain Knowledge. After
many years it might be found practicable to put forth by
authority a carefully considered Revision of the commonly
received Greek Text.

§ 24. But instead of all this, a Revision of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">English
Authorised Version</span></em> having been sanctioned by the Convocation
of the Southern Province in 1871, the opportunity was
eagerly snatched at by two irresponsible scholars of the
University of Cambridge for obtaining the general sanction
of the Revising body, and thus indirectly of Convocation, for
a private venture of their own,—their own privately devised
Revision of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Greek Text</span></em>. On that Greek Text of theirs,
(which I hold to be the most depraved which has ever
appeared in print), with some slight modifications, our
Authorised English Version has been silently revised: silently,
I say, for in the margin of the English no record is preserved
of the underlying Textual changes which have been introduced
by the Revisionists. On the contrary. Use has been made
of that margin to insinuate suspicion and distrust in countless
particulars as to the authenticity of the Text which
has been suffered to remain unaltered. In the meantime,
the country has been flooded with two editions of the New
Greek Text; and thus the door has been set wide open for
universal mistrust of the Truth of Scripture to enter.

§ 25. Even schoolboys, it seems, are to have these crude
views thrust upon them. Witness the <span class="tei tei-q">“Cambridge Greek
Testament for Schools,”</span> edited by Dean Perowne,—who informs
us at the outset that <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the Syndics of the Cambridge
University Press</span></em> have not thought it desirable to reprint the
text in common use.”</span> A consensus of Drs. Tischendorf and
Tregelles,—who confessedly employed <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the self-same mistaken
major premiss</span></em> in remodelling the Sacred Text,—seems, in a
general way, to represent those Syndics' notion of Textual
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexxxi">[pg xxxi]</span><a name="Pgxxxi" id="Pgxxxi" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
purity. By this means every most serious deformity in the
edition of Drs. Westcott and Hort, becomes promoted to
honour, and is being thrust on the unsuspecting youth of
England as the genuine utterance of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Holy Ghost</span></span>.
Would it not have been the fairer, the more faithful as well
as the more judicious course,—seeing that in respect of this
abstruse and important question <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">adhuc sub judice lis est</span></span>,—to
wait patiently awhile? Certainly not to snatch an opportunity
<span class="tei tei-q">“while men slept,”</span> and in this way indirectly to prejudge
the solemn issue! Not by such methods is the cause
of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">God's</span></span> Truth on earth to be promoted. Even this however
is not all. Bishop Lightfoot has been informed that <span class="tei tei-q">“the
Bible Society has permitted its Translators to adopt the Text
of the Revised Version <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">where it commends itself to their
judgment</span></em>.”</span><a id="noteref_27" name="noteref_27" href="#note_27"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">27</span></span></a> In other words, persons wholly unacquainted
with the dangers which beset this delicate and difficult
problem are invited to determine, by the light of Nature
and on the <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">solvere ambulando</span></span>”</span> principle, what <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">is</span></em> inspired
Scripture, what <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">not</span></em>: and as a necessary consequence are encouraged
to disseminate in heathen lands Readings which, a
few years hence,—(so at least I venture to predict,)—will
be universally recognized as worthless.

descending into the arena of controversy, it would in my
judgment be impossible to indicate an occasion when the

At a period of extraordinary intellectual activity like the
present, it can occasion no surprise—although it may
reasonably create anxiety—if the most sacred and cherished
of our Institutions are constrained each in turn to submit to
the ordeal of hostile scrutiny; sometimes even to bear the
brunt of actual attack. When however at last the very
citadel of revealed Truth is observed to have been reached,
and to be undergoing systematic assault and battery,
lookers-on may be excused if they show themselves more
than usually solicitous, <span class="tei tei-q">“ne quid detrimenti Civitas DEI

Testament,<a id="noteref_31" name="noteref_31" href="#note_31"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">31</span></span></a> purporting to have been executed by authority
of the Convocation of the Southern Province, and declaring
itself the exclusive property of our two ancient Universities,
has recently (17th May, 1881) appeared; of which the
essential feature proves to be, that it is founded on an
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page002">[pg 002]</span><a name="Pg002" id="Pg002" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">entirely New Recension of the Greek Text</span></em>.<a id="noteref_32" name="noteref_32" href="#note_32"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">32</span></span></a> A claim is at
the same time set up on behalf of the last-named production
that it exhibits a closer approximation to the inspired Autographs
than the world has hitherto seen. Not unreasonable
therefore is the expectation entertained by its Authors that
the <span class="tei tei-q">“New English Version”</span> founded on this <span class="tei tei-q">“New Greek
Text”</span> is destined to supersede the <span class="tei tei-q">“Authorized Version”</span> of
1611. <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Quæ cum ita sint</span></span>, it is clearly high time that every
faithful man among us should bestir himself: and in
particular that such as have made Greek Textual Criticism
in any degree their study should address themselves to the
investigation of the claims of this, the latest product of the
combined Biblical learning of the Church and of the sects.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
For it must be plain to all, that the issue which has been
thus at last raised, is of the most serious character. The
Authors of this new Revision of the Greek have either entitled
themselves to the Church's profound reverence and abiding
gratitude; or else they have laid themselves open to her
gravest censure, and must experience at her hands nothing
short of stern and well-merited rebuke. No middle course
presents itself; since assuredly <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">to construct a new Greek Text</span></em>
formed no part of the Instructions which the Revisionists
received at the hands of the Convocation of the Southern
Province. Rather were they warned against venturing on
such an experiment; the fundamental principle of the entire
undertaking having been declared at the outset to be—That
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page003">[pg 003]</span><a name="Pg003" id="Pg003" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<span class="tei tei-q">“a Revision of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Authorized Version</span></span>”</span> is desirable; and the
terms of the original Resolution of Feb. 10th, 1870, being,
that the removal of <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">plain and clear errors</span></span>”</span> was alone
contemplated,—<span class="tei tei-q">“whether in the Greek Text originally adopted
by the Translators, or in the Translation made from the
same.”</span> Such were in fact <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the limits formally imposed by Convocation</span></em>,
(10th Feb. and 3rd, 5th May, 1870,) <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">on the work of
Revision</span></em>. Only <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">necessary</span></span> changes were to be made. The
first Rule of the Committee (25th May) was similar in
character: viz.—<span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">To introduce as few alterations as possible
into the Text of the Authorized Version</span></em>, consistently with faithfulness.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But further, we were reconciled to the prospect of a
Revised Greek Text, by noting that a limit was prescribed to
the amount of licence which could by possibility result, by
the insertion of a proviso, which however is now discovered
to have been entirely disregarded by the Revisionists. The
condition was enjoined upon them that whenever <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">decidedly
preponderating evidence</span></em>”</span> constrained their adoption of some
change in <span class="tei tei-q">“the Text from which the Authorized Version was
made,”</span> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">they should indicate such alteration in the margin</span></em>.
Will it be believed that, this notwithstanding, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">not one</span></em> of the
many alterations which have been introduced into the
original Text is so commemorated? On the contrary: singular
to relate, the Margin is disfigured throughout with
ominous hints that, had <span class="tei tei-q">“Some ancient authorities,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Many
ancient authorities,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Many very ancient authorities,”</span> been
attended to, a vast many more changes might, could, would,
or should have been introduced into the Greek Text than
have been actually adopted. And yet, this is precisely the
kind of record which we ought to have been spared:—
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(1) First,—Because it was plainly external to the province
of the Revisionists to introduce any such details into their
margin <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">at all</span></em>: their very function being, on the contrary, to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page004">[pg 004]</span><a name="Pg004" id="Pg004" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
investigate Textual questions in conclave, and to present the
ordinary Reader with <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the result</span></em> of their deliberations. Their
business was to correct <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">plain and clear errors</span></em>;”</span> not,
certainly, to invent a fresh crop of unheard-of doubts and
difficulties. This first.—Now,
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(2) That a diversity of opinion would sometimes be found
to exist in the revising body was to have been expected, but
when once two-thirds of their number had finally <span class="tei tei-q">“settled”</span>
any question, it is plainly unreasonable that the discomfited
minority should claim the privilege of evermore parading
their grievance before the public; and in effect should be
allowed to represent <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">that</span></em> as a corporate doubt, which was in
reality the result of individual idiosyncrasy. It is not
reasonable that the echoes of a forgotten strife should be
thus prolonged for ever; least of all in the margin of <span class="tei tei-q">“the
Gospel of peace.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(3) In fact, the privilege of figuring in the margin of
the N. T., (instead of standing in the Text,) is even attended
by a fatal result: for, (as Bp. Ellicott remarks,) <span class="tei tei-q">“the judgment
commonly entertained in reference to our present
margin,”</span> (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> the margin of the A. V.) is, that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">its contents are</span></em>
<span class="tei tei-q">“exegetically or critically <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">superior to the Text</span></em>.”</span><a id="noteref_33" name="noteref_33" href="#note_33"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">33</span></span></a> It will
certainly be long before this popular estimate is unconditionally
abandoned. But,
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(4) Especially do we deprecate the introduction into the
margin of all this strange lore, because we insist on behalf
of unlearned persons that they ought not to be molested
with information which cannot, by possibility, be of the
slightest service to them: with vague statements about
<span class="tei tei-q">“ancient authorities,”</span>—of the importance, or unimportance,
of which they know absolutely nothing, nor indeed ever can
know. Unlearned readers on taking the Revision into their

Undeniable at all events it is, that the effect which these
ever-recurring announcements produce on the devout reader
of Scripture is the reverse of edifying: is never helpful: is
always bewildering. A man of ordinary acuteness can but
exclaim,—<span class="tei tei-q">“Yes, very likely. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">But what of it</span></em>? My eye
happens to alight on <span class="tei tei-q">‘Bethesda’</span> (in S. John v. 2); against
which I find in the margin,—<span class="tei tei-q">‘Some ancient authorities read

in the judgment of the Revisionists it is uncertain <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">which</span></em> of
those three names is right?”</span>... Not so the expert, who is
overheard to moralize concerning the phenomena of the case
after a less ceremonious fashion:—<span class="tei tei-q">“ <span class="tei tei-q">‘<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Bethsaida</span></span>’</span>! Yes, the

speak plainly, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Why encumber your margin with such a note at
all?</span></em>”</span>... But we are moving forward too fast.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It can never be any question among scholars, that a fatal
error was committed when a body of Divines, appointed <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">to
revise the Authorized English Version</span></em> of the New Testament
Scriptures, addressed themselves to the solution of an entirely
different and far more intricate problem, namely <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the re-construction
of the Greek Text</span></em>. We are content to pass over
much that is distressing in the antecedent history of their
enterprise. We forbear at this time of day to investigate, by
an appeal to documents and dates, certain proceedings in and
out of Convocation, on which it is known that the gravest
diversity of sentiment still prevails among Churchmen.<a id="noteref_41" name="noteref_41" href="#note_41"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">41</span></span></a>
This we do, not by any means as ourselves <span class="tei tei-q">“halting between
two opinions,”</span> but only as sincerely desirous that the work
before us may stand or fall, judged by its own intrinsic
merits. Whether or no Convocation,—when it <span class="tei tei-q">“nominated
certain of its own members to undertake the work of Revision,”</span>
and authorized them <span class="tei tei-q">“to refer when they considered it
desirable to Divines, Scholars, and Literary men, at home or
abroad, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">for their opinion</span></em>;”</span>—whether Convocation intended
thereby to sanction the actual <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">co-optation</span></em> into the Company
appointed by themselves, of members of the Presbyterian,
the Wesleyan, the Baptist, the Congregationalist, the Socinian
body; <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">this</span></em> we venture to think may fairly be doubted.—Whether
again Convocation can have foreseen that of the
ninety-nine Scholars in all who have taken part in this work
of Revision, only forty-nine would be Churchmen, while the
remaining fifty would belong to the sects:<a id="noteref_42" name="noteref_42" href="#note_42"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">42</span></span></a>—<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">this</span></em> also we
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page007">[pg 007]</span><a name="Pg007" id="Pg007" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
venture to think may be reasonably called in question.—Whether
lastly, the Canterbury Convocation, had it been
appealed to with reference to <span class="tei tei-q">“the Westminster-Abbey
scandal”</span> (June 22nd, 1870), would not have cleared itself of
the suspicion of complicity, by an unequivocal resolution,—we
entertain no manner of doubt.—But we decline to enter
upon these, or any other like matters. Our business is exclusively
with the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">result</span></em> at which the Revisionists of the New
Testament have arrived: and it is to this that we now
address ourselves; with the mere avowal of our grave anxiety
at the spectacle of an assembly of scholars, appointed to
revise <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">an English Translation</span></em>, finding themselves called
upon, as every fresh difficulty emerged, to develop the skill
requisite for <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">critically revising the original Greek Text</span></em>. What
else is implied by the very endeavour, but a singular expectation
that experts in one Science may, at a moment's
notice, show themselves proficients in another,—and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">that</span></em> one
of the most difficult and delicate imaginable?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Enough has been said to make it plain why, in the ensuing
pages, we propose to pursue a different course from that
which has been adopted by Reviewers generally, since the
memorable day (May 17th, 1881) when the work of the
Revisionists was for the first time submitted to public
scrutiny. The one point which, with rare exceptions, has
ever since monopolized attention, has been the merits or
demerits of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">their English rendering</span></em> of certain Greek words
and expressions. But there is clearly a question of prior
interest and infinitely greater importance, which has to be
settled first: namely, the merits or demerits of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the changes
which the same Scholars have taken upon themselves to introduce
into the Greek Text</span></em>. Until it has been ascertained that
the result of their labours exhibits a decided improvement
upon what before was read, it is clearly a mere waste of time
to enquire into the merits of their work as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Revisers of a
</span><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page008">[pg 008]</span><a name="Pg008" id="Pg008" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span style="font-style: italic">
Translation</span></em>. But in fact it has to be proved that the
Revisionists have restricted themselves to the removal of
<span class="tei tei-q">“plain and clear <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">errors</span></em>”</span> from the commonly received Text.
We are distressed to discover that, on the contrary, they
have done something quite different. The treatment which
the N. T. has experienced at the hands of the Revisionists
recals the fate of some ancient edifice which confessedly
required to be painted, papered, scoured,—with a minimum
of masons' and carpenters' work,—in order to be inhabited
with comfort for the next hundred years: but those entrusted
with the job were so ill-advised as to persuade themselves that
it required to be to a great extent rebuilt. Accordingly, in an
evil hour they set about removing foundations, and did so
much structural mischief that in the end it became necessary
to proceed against them for damages.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Without the remotest intention of imposing views of our
own on the general Reader, but only to enable him to give
his intelligent assent to much that is to follow, we find ourselves
constrained in the first instance,—before conducting
him over any part of the domain which the Revisionists have
ventured uninvited to occupy,—to premise a few ordinary
facts which lie on the threshold of the science of Textual
Criticism. Until these have been clearly apprehended, no
progress whatever is possible.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(1) The provision, then, which the Divine Author of
Scripture is found to have made for the preservation in its
integrity of His written Word, is of a peculiarly varied and
highly complex description. First,—By causing that a vast
multiplication of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Copies</span></span> should be required all down the ages,—beginning
at the earliest period, and continuing in an ever-increasing
ratio until the actual invention of Printing,—He
provided the most effectual security imaginable against fraud.
True, that millions of the copies so produced have long since
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page009">[pg 009]</span><a name="Pg009" id="Pg009" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
perished: but it is nevertheless a plain fact that there
survive of the Gospels alone upwards of one thousand copies
to the present day.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(2) Next, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Versions</span></span>. The necessity of translating the Scriptures
into divers languages for the use of different branches
of the early Church, procured that many an authentic record
has been preserved of the New Testament as it existed in the
first few centuries of the Christian era. Thus, the Peschito
Syriac and the old Latin version are believed to have been
executed in the IInd century. <span class="tei tei-q">“It is no stretch of imagination”</span>
(wrote Bp. Ellicott in 1870,) <span class="tei tei-q">“to suppose that portions
of the Peschito might have been in the hands of S. John, or
that the Old Latin represented the current views of the
Roman Christians of the IInd century.”</span><a id="noteref_43" name="noteref_43" href="#note_43"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">43</span></span></a> The two Egyptian
translations are referred to the IIIrd and IVth. The Vulgate
(or revised Latin) and the Gothic are also claimed for the
IVth: the Armenian, and possibly the Æthiopic, belong to
the Vth.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(3) Lastly, the requirements of assailants and apologists
alike, the business of Commentators, the needs of controversialists
and teachers in every age, have resulted in a vast
accumulation of additional evidence, of which it is scarcely
possible to over-estimate the importance. For in this way it
has come to pass that every famous Doctor of the Church in
turn has quoted more or less largely from the sacred writings,
and thus has borne testimony to the contents of the codices
with which he was individually familiar. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Patristic Citations</span></span>
accordingly are a third mighty safeguard of the integrity
of the deposit.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
To weigh these three instruments of Criticism—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Copies</span></span>,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Versions</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Fathers</span></span>—one against another, is obviously impossible
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page010">[pg 010]</span><a name="Pg010" id="Pg010" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
on the present occasion. Such a discussion would
grow at once into a treatise.<a id="noteref_44" name="noteref_44" href="#note_44"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">44</span></span></a> Certain explanatory details,
together with a few words of caution, are as much as may be
attempted.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I. And, first of all, the reader has need to be apprised
(with reference to the first-named class of evidence) that most
of our extant <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">copies</span></span> of the N. T. Scriptures are comparatively
of recent date, ranging from the Xth to the XIVth century of
our era. That these are in every instance copies of yet older
manuscripts, is self-evident; and that in the main they
represent faithfully the sacred autographs themselves, no
reasonable person doubts.<a id="noteref_45" name="noteref_45" href="#note_45"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">45</span></span></a> Still, it is undeniable that
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page011">[pg 011]</span><a name="Pg011" id="Pg011" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
they <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">are</span></em> thus separated by about a thousand years from their
inspired archetypes. Readers are reminded, in passing, that
the little handful of copies on which we rely for the texts of
Herodotus and Thucydides, of Æschylus and Sophocles, are
removed from <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">their</span></em> originals by full 500 years more: and
that, instead of a thousand, or half a thousand copies, we are
dependent for the text of certain of these authors on as many
copies as may be counted on the fingers of one hand. In
truth, the security which the Text of the New Testament
enjoys is altogether unique and extraordinary. To specify
one single consideration, which has never yet attracted nearly
the amount of attention it deserves,—<span class="tei tei-q">“Lectionaries”</span> abound,
which establish the Text which has been publicly read in the
churches of the East, from <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">at least</span></em> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 400 until the time of
the invention of printing.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But here an important consideration claims special attention.
We allude to the result of increased acquaintance with
certain of the oldest extant codices of the N. T. Two of
these,—viz. a copy in the Vatican technically indicated by
the letter <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b</span></span>, and the recently-discovered Sinaitic codex, styled
after the first letter of the Hebrew alphabet א,—are thought
to belong to the IVth century. Two are assigned to the Vth,
viz. the Alexandrian (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a</span></span>) in the British Museum, and the
rescript codex preserved at Paris, designated <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">c</span></span>. One is probably
of the VIth, viz. the codex Bezæ (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">d</span></span>) preserved at
Cambridge. Singular to relate, the first, second, fourth, and
fifth of these codices (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b</span></span> א <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">c d</span></span>), but especially <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b</span></span> and א, have
within the last twenty years established a tyrannical ascendency
over the imagination of the Critics, which can only be
fitly spoken of as a blind superstition. It matters nothing
that all four are discovered on careful scrutiny to differ
essentially, not only from ninety-nine out of a hundred of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page012">[pg 012]</span><a name="Pg012" id="Pg012" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the whole body of extant MSS. besides, but even <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">from one
another</span></em>. This last circumstance, obviously fatal to their
corporate pretensions, is unaccountably overlooked. And
yet it admits of only one satisfactory explanation: viz. that
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in different degrees</span></em> they all five exhibit a fabricated text.
Between the first two (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b</span></span> and א) there subsists an amount of
sinister resemblance, which proves that they must have been
derived at no very remote period from the same corrupt
original. Tischendorf insists that they were partly written
by the same scribe. Yet do they stand asunder in every
page; as well as differ widely from the commonly received
Text, with which they have been carefully collated. On
being referred to this standard, in the Gospels alone, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b</span></span> is
found to omit at least 2877 words: to add, 536: to substitute,
935: to transpose, 2098: to modify, 1132 (in all 7578):—the
corresponding figures for א being severally 3455, 839,
1114, 2299, 1265 (in all 8972). And be it remembered that
the omissions, additions, substitutions, transpositions, and
modifications, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">are by no means the same</span></em> in both. It is in
fact <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">easier to find two consecutive verses in which these two
MSS. differ the one from the other, than two consecutive verses
in which they entirely agree</span></em>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But by far the most depraved text is that exhibited
by codex <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">d</span></span>. <span class="tei tei-q">“No known manuscript contains so many
bold and extensive interpolations. Its variations from
the sacred Text are beyond all other example.”</span><a id="noteref_46" name="noteref_46" href="#note_46"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">46</span></span></a> This,
however, is not the result of its being the most recent of
the five, but (singular to relate) is due to quite an opposite
cause. It is thought (not without reason) to exhibit a
IInd-century text. <span class="tei tei-q">“When we turn to the Acts of the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page013">[pg 013]</span><a name="Pg013" id="Pg013" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Apostles,”</span> (says the learned editor of the codex in question,
Dr. Scrivener,<a id="noteref_47" name="noteref_47" href="#note_47"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">47</span></span></a>)—

a large portion of the Gospels is missing, in what remains
(tested by the same standard) we find 3704 words omitted:
no less than 2213 added, and 2121 substituted. The words
transposed amount to 3471: and 1772 have been modified:
the deflections from the Received Text thus amounting in all
to 13,281.—Next to <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">d</span></span>, the most untrustworthy codex is א,
which bears on its front a memorable note of the evil repute
under which it has always laboured: viz. it is found that at
least <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ten</span></em> revisers between the IVth and the XIIth centuries
busied themselves with the task of correcting its many and
extraordinary perversions of the truth of Scripture.<a id="noteref_48" name="noteref_48" href="#note_48"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">48</span></span></a>—Next in

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
What precedes admits to some extent of further numerical
illustration. It is discovered that in the 111 (out of 320)
pages of an ordinary copy of the Greek Testament, in which
alone these five manuscripts are collectively available for
comparison in the Gospels,—the serious deflections of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a</span></span> from
the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Textus receptus</span></span> amount in all to only 842: whereas in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">c</span></span>
they amount to 1798: in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b</span></span>, to 2370: in א, to 3392: in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">d</span></span>, to
4697. The readings <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">peculiar to</span></em> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a</span></span> within the same limits are
133: those peculiar to <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">c</span></span> are 170. But those of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b</span></span> amount to
197: while א exhibits 443: and the readings peculiar to <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">d</span></span>
(within the same limits), are no fewer than 1829.... We
submit that these facts—<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">which result from merely referring

What (we ask) would be thought of four such <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">copies</span></em>”</span> of
Thucydides or of Shakspeare? Imagine it gravely proposed,

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And yet—without by any means subscribing to the precise
terms in which the judicious Prelate characterizes those <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">ignes
fatui</span></span> which have so persistently and egregiously led his lordship
and his colleagues astray—(for indeed one seems rather
to be reading a description of four styles of composition, or
of as many fashions in ladies' dress, than of four copies of
the Gospel)—we have already furnished indirect proof that
his estimate of the codices in question is in the main correct.
Further acquaintance with them does but intensify the bad
character which he has given them. Let no one suppose
that we deny their extraordinary value,—their unrivalled
critical interest,—nay, their actual <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">use</span></em> in helping to settle

again to trouble him with detailed specimens of the contents
of א <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b</span></span>, &amp;c., in proof of the justice of what we have been
alleging. We venture to assure him, without a particle of
hesitation, that א <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b d</span></span> are <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">three of the most scandalously

But in fact take a single page of any ordinary copy of the
Greek Testament,—Bp. Lloyd's edition, suppose. Turn to page
184. It contains ten verses of S. Luke's Gospel, ch. viii. 35 to
44. Now, proceed to collate those ten verses. You will make
the notable discovery that, within those narrow limits, by codex
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">d</span></span> alone the text has been depraved 53 times, resulting in no
less than 103 corrupt readings, 93 <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">of which are found only in</span></em>
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">d</span></span>. The words omitted by <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">d</span></span> are 40: the words added are 4.
Twenty-five words have been substituted for others, and 14
transposed. Variations of case, tense, &amp;c., amount to 16; and
the phrase of the Evangelist has been departed from 11 times.
Happily, the other four <span class="tei tei-q">“old uncials”</span> are here available. And
it is found that (within the same limits, and referred to the
same test,) <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a</span></span> exhibits 3 omissions, 2 of which are <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">peculiar to</span></em>
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a</span></span>.—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b</span></span> omits 12 words, 6 of which are <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">peculiar to</span></em> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b</span></span>: substitutes
3 words: transposes 4: and exhibits 6 lesser changes—2
of them being its own peculiar property.—א has 5 readings
(affecting 8 words) <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">peculiar to itself</span></em>. Its omissions are 7:
its additions, 2: its substitutions, 4: 2 words are transposed;
and it exhibits 4 lesser discrepancies.—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">c</span></span> has 7 readings
(affecting 15 words) <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">peculiar to itself</span></em>. Its omissions are 4:

It has 2 lesser discrepancies, and it alters the Evangelist's

But (we shall be asked) what amount of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">agreement</span></em>, in
respect of <span class="tei tei-q">“Various Readings,”</span> is discovered to subsist between
these 5 codices? for <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">that</span></em>, after all, is the practical question.
We answer,—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a</span></span> has been already shown to stand alone
twice: <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b</span></span>, 6 times: א, 8 times: <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">c</span></span>, 15 times; <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">d</span></span>, 93 times.—We

once: <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b</span></span> א, 4 times: <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b c</span></span>, 1: <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b d</span></span>, 1: א <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">c</span></span>, 1: <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">c d</span></span>, 1.—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a</span></span>

reading): <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b</span></span> א <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">c d</span></span>, also <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">once</span></em>.—The 5 <span class="tei tei-q">“old uncials”</span> therefore

impartiality.—Lastly, they are <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">never once</span></em> found to be in
accord in respect of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">any single </span><span class="tei tei-q">“various Reading”</span></em>.—Will any
one, after a candid survey of the premisses, deem us unreasonable,
if we avow that such a specimen of the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">concordia
discors</span></span> which everywhere prevails between the oldest
uncials, but which especially characterizes א <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b d</span></span>, indisposes
us greatly to suffer their unsupported authority to determine
for us the Text of Scripture?

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Let no one at all events obscure the one question at
issue, by asking,—<span class="tei tei-q">“Whether we consider the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Textus Receptus</span></span>
infallible?”</span> The merit or demerit of the Received Text has
absolutely <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">nothing whatever to do with the question</span></em>. We care
nothing about it. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Any</span></em> Text would equally suit our present
purpose. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Any</span></em> Text would show the <span class="tei tei-q">“old uncials”</span> perpetually
at discord <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">among themselves</span></em>. To raise an irrelevant
discussion, at the outset, concerning the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Textus Receptus</span></span>:—to
describe the haste with which Erasmus produced the first
published edition of the N. T.:—to make sport about the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page018">[pg 018]</span><a name="Pg018" id="Pg018" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
copies which he employed:—all this kind of thing is the
proceeding of one who seeks to mislead his readers:—to throw
dust into their eyes:—to divert their attention from the problem
actually before them:—<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">not</span></em>—(as we confidently expect
when we have to do with such writers as these)—the method
of a sincere lover of Truth. To proceed, however.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
II. and III. Nothing has been said as yet concerning the
Text exhibited by the earliest of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Versions</span></span> and by the
most ancient of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Fathers</span></span>. But, for the purpose we have
just now in hand, neither are such details necessary. We
desire to hasten forward. A somewhat fuller review of
certain of our oldest available materials might prove even
more discouraging. But <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">that</span></em> would only be because it is
impossible, within such narrow limits as the present, to give
the reader any idea at all of the wealth of our actual
resources; and to convince him of the extent to which the
least trustworthy of our guides prove in turn invaluable
helps in correcting the exorbitances of their fellows. The
practical result in fact of what has been hitherto offered is
after all but this, that we have to be on our guard against
pinning our faith exclusively on two or three,—least of all
on one or two ancient documents; and of adopting <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">them</span></em>
exclusively for our guides. We are shown, in other words,
that it is utterly out of the question to rely on any single
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">set</span></em> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">group</span></em> of authorities, much less on any single document,
for the determination of the Text of Scripture.
Happily, our <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Manuscripts</span></span> are numerous: most of them are
in the main trustworthy: <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">all</span></em> of them represent far older
documents than themselves. Our <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Versions</span></span> (two of which
are more ancient by a couple of centuries than any sacred
codex extant) severally correct and check one another.
Lastly, in the writings of a host of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Fathers</span></span>,—the principal
being Eusebius, Athanasius, Basil, the Gregories, Didymus,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page019">[pg 019]</span><a name="Pg019" id="Pg019" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Epiphanius, Chrysostom, the Cyrils, Theodoret,—we are provided
with contemporaneous evidence which, whenever it
can be had, becomes an effectual safeguard against the unsupported
decrees of our oldest codices, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a b</span></span> א <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">c d</span></span>, as well as
the occasional vagaries of the Versions. In the writings of
Irenæus, Clemens Alex., Origen, Dionysius Alex., Hippolytus,
we meet with older evidence still. No more precarious
foundation for a reading, in fact, can be named, than the
unsupported advocacy of a single Manuscript, or Version, or
Father; or even of two or three of these combined.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But indeed the principle involved in the foregoing remarks
admits of being far more broadly stated. It even stands
to reason that we may safely reject any reading which, out
of the whole body of available authorities,—Manuscripts,
Versions, Fathers,—finds support nowhere save in one and
the same little handful of suspicious documents. For we
resolutely maintain, that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">external Evidence</span></em> must after all be
our best, our only safe guide; and (to come to the point) we
refuse to throw in our lot with those who, disregarding the
witness of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">every other</span></em> known Codex—<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">every other</span></em> Version—<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">every
other</span></em> available Ecclesiastical Writer,—insist on following
the dictates of a little group of authorities, of which nothing
whatever is known with so much certainty as that often,
when they concur exclusively, it is to mislead. We speak of
codices <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b</span></span> or א or <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">d</span></span>; the IXth-century codex <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">l</span></span>, and such
cursives<a id="noteref_50" name="noteref_50" href="#note_50"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">50</span></span></a> as 13 or 33; a few copies of the old Latin and
one of the Egyptian versions: perhaps Origen.—Not theory
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page020">[pg 020]</span><a name="Pg020" id="Pg020" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
therefore:—not prejudice:—not conjecture:—not unproved
assertion:—not any single codex, and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">certainly</span></em> not codex <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b</span></span>:—not
an imaginary <span class="tei tei-q">“Antiochene Recension”</span> of another
imaginary <span class="tei tei-q">“Pre-Syrian Text:”</span>—not antecedent fancies about
the affinity of documents:—neither <span class="tei tei-q">“the [purely arbitrary]
method of genealogy,”</span>—nor one man's notions (<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">which may be
reversed by another man's notions</span></em>) of <span class="tei tei-q">“Transcriptional Probability:”</span>—not
<span class="tei tei-q">“instinctive processes of Criticism,”</span>—least of
all <span class="tei tei-q">“the individual mind,”</span> with its <span class="tei tei-q">“supposed power of
divining the Original Text”</span>—of which no intelligible account
can be rendered:—nothing of this sort,—(however specious
and plausible it may sound, especially when set forth in
confident language; advocated with a great show of unintelligible
learning; supported by a formidable array of
cabalistic symbols and mysterious contractions; above all
when recommended by justly respected names,)—nothing of
this sort, we say, must be allowed to determine for us the
Text of Scripture. The very proposal should set us on our
guard against the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">certainty</span></em> of imposition.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We deem it even axiomatic, that, in every case of doubt
or difficulty—supposed or real—our critical method must
be the same: namely, after patiently collecting <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">all</span></em> the
available evidence, then, without partiality or prejudice, to
adjudicate between the conflicting authorities, and loyally to
accept that verdict for which there is clearly the preponderating
evidence. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">The best supported Reading</span></em>, in other words,
must always be held to be <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the true Reading</span></em>: and nothing
may be rejected from the commonly received Text, except on
evidence which shall <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">clearly</span></em> outweigh the evidence for
retaining it. We are glad to know that, so far at least, we
once had Bp. Ellicott with us. He announced (in 1870) that
the best way of proceeding with the work of Revision is, <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">to
make the Textus Receptus the standard</span></em>,—departing from it
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page021">[pg 021]</span><a name="Pg021" id="Pg021" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">only when</span></em> critical or grammatical considerations <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">show that it
is clearly necessary</span></em>.”</span><a id="noteref_51" name="noteref_51" href="#note_51"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">51</span></span></a> We ourselves mean no more. Whenever
the evidence is about evenly balanced, few it is hoped
will deny that the Text which has been <span class="tei tei-q">“in possession”</span> for
three centuries and a half, and which rests on infinitely
better manuscript evidence than that of any ancient work
which can be named,—should, for every reason, be let
alone.<a id="noteref_52" name="noteref_52" href="#note_52"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">52</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But, (we shall perhaps be asked,) has any critical Editor
of the N. T. seriously taught the reverse of all this? Yes
indeed, we answer. Lachmann, Tregelles, Tischendorf,—the
most recent and most famous of modern editors,—have all
three adopted a directly opposite theory of textual revision.
With the first-named, fifty years ago (1831), virtually originated
the principle of recurring exclusively to a few ancient
documents to the exclusion of the many. <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lachmann's</span></span> text

Lachmann's leading fallacy has perforce proved fatal to
the value of the text put forth by <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Dr. Tregelles</span></span>. Of the
scrupulous accuracy, the indefatigable industry, the pious
zeal of that estimable and devoted scholar, we speak not.
All honour to his memory! As a specimen of conscientious
labour, his edition of the N. T. (1857-72) passes praise, and
will <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">never</span></em> lose its value. But it has only to be stated, that
Tregelles effectually persuaded himself that <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">eighty-nine
ninetieths</span></em>”</span> of our extant manuscripts and other authorities
may safely be rejected and lost sight of when we come to
amend the text and try to restore it to its primitive purity,<a id="noteref_56" name="noteref_56" href="#note_56"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">56</span></span></a>—to
make it plain that in Textual Criticism he must needs
be regarded as an untrustworthy teacher. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Why</span></em> he should
have condescended to employ no patristic authority later
than Eusebius [fl. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 320], he does not explain. <span class="tei tei-q">“His
critical principles,”</span> (says Bishop Ellicott,) <span class="tei tei-q">“especially his
general principles of estimating and regarding modern manuscripts,
are now perhaps justly called in question.”</span><a id="noteref_57" name="noteref_57" href="#note_57"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">57</span></span></a>

<span class="tei tei-q">“The case of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Dr. Tischendorf</span></span>”</span> (proceeds Bp. Ellicott) <span class="tei tei-q">“is
still more easily disposed of. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Which</span></em> of this most inconstant
Critic's texts are we to select? Surely not the last, in which
an exaggerated preference for a single Manuscript which he
has had the good fortune to discover, has betrayed him into
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page023">[pg 023]</span><a name="Pg023" id="Pg023" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
an almost child-like infirmity of critical judgment. Surely
also not his seventh edition, which ... exhibits all the
instability which a comparatively recent recognition of the
authority of cursive manuscripts might be supposed likely to
introduce.”</span><a id="noteref_58" name="noteref_58" href="#note_58"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">58</span></span></a> With Dr. Tischendorf,—(whom one vastly his
superior in learning, accuracy, and judgment, has generously
styled <span class="tei tei-q">“the first Biblical Critic in Europe”</span><a id="noteref_59" name="noteref_59" href="#note_59"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">59</span></span></a>)—<span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the evidence
of codex</span></em> א, supported or even unsupported by one or two
other authorities of any description, is sufficient to outweigh
any other witnesses,—whether Manuscripts, Versions, or
ecclesiastical Writers.”</span><a id="noteref_60" name="noteref_60" href="#note_60"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">60</span></span></a> We need say no more. Until the
foregoing charge has been disproved, Dr. Tischendorf's last
edition of the N. T., however precious as a vast storehouse of
materials for criticism,—however admirable as a specimen
of unwearied labour, critical learning, and first-rate ability,—must
be admitted to be an utterly unsatisfactory exhibition
of the inspired Text. It has been ascertained that
his discovery of codex א caused his 8th edition (1865-72)
to differ from his 7th in no less than 3505 places,—<span class="tei tei-q">“to the
scandal of the science of Comparative Criticism, as well as to
his own grave discredit for discernment and consistency.”</span><a id="noteref_61" name="noteref_61" href="#note_61"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">61</span></span></a>
But, in fact, what is to be thought of a Critic who,—because
the last verse of S. John's Gospel, in א, seemed to himself to
be <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">written with a different pen</span></em> from the rest,—has actually
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">omitted that verse</span></em> (xxi. 25) entirely, in defiance of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">every
known Copy, every known Version</span></em>, and the explicit testimony
of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">a host of Fathers</span></em>? Such are Origen (in 11 places),—Eusebius
(in 3),—Gregory Nyss. (in 2),—Gregory Nazian.,—ps.-Dionys.
Alex.,<a id="noteref_62" name="noteref_62" href="#note_62"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">62</span></span></a>—Nonnus,—Chrysostom (in 6 places),—Theodoras

Cretensis,—Ambrose,—Gaudentius,—Philastrius,— Sedulius,—Jerome,—Augustine
(in 6 places). That Tischendorf was
a critic of amazing research, singular shrewdness, indefatigable
industry; and that he enjoyed an unrivalled familiarity
with ancient documents; no fair person will deny. But (in
the words of Bishop Ellicott,<a id="noteref_63" name="noteref_63" href="#note_63"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">63</span></span></a> whom we quote so perseveringly
for a reason not hard to divine,) his <span class="tei tei-q">“great inconstancy,”</span>—his
<span class="tei tei-q">“natural want of sobriety of critical judgment,”</span>—and his
<span class="tei tei-q">“unreasonable deference to the readings found in his own
codex Sinaiticus;”</span>—to which should be added <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the utter
absence in him of any intelligible fixed critical principles</span></em>;”</span>—all
this makes Tischendorf one of the worst of guides to
the true Text of Scripture.

<span class="tei tei-q">“Textual Criticism made easy,”</span> certainly. Well aware of the
preposterous results to which such a major premiss must
inevitably lead, we are not surprised to find a plea straightway

our confidence fairly gives way when, in the same breath, the

obliged to come to the individual mind</span></em> at last; and canons of
Criticism are useful only as warnings against <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">natural illusions</span></em>,
and aids to circumspect consideration, not as absolute
rules to prescribe the final decision. It is true that no <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">individual
mind</span></em> can ever work with perfect uniformity, or free
itself completely from <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">its own idiosyncrasies</span></em>. Yet a clear
sense of the danger of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">unconscious caprice</span></em> may do much
towards excluding it. We trust also that the present Text
has escaped some risks of this kind by being the joint production
of two Editors of different habits of mind”</span><a id="noteref_69" name="noteref_69" href="#note_69"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">69</span></span></a> ... A
somewhat insecure safeguard surely! May we be permitted
without offence to point out that the <span class="tei tei-q">“idiosyncrasies”</span> of an
<span class="tei tei-q">“individual mind”</span> (to which we learn with astonishment <span class="tei tei-q">“we
are obliged to come at last”</span>) are probably the very worst
foundation possible on which to build the recension of an
inspired writing? With regret we record our conviction,
that these accomplished scholars have succeeded in producing
a Text vastly more remote from the inspired autographs of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page026">[pg 026]</span><a name="Pg026" id="Pg026" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the Evangelists than any which has appeared since the

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page027">[pg 027]</span><a name="Pg027" id="Pg027" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
judge from the Remarks (in pp. 541-62) which the learned
Editors (Revisionists themselves) have subjoined to their
elegantly-printed volume, it is to be feared that the fabric
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page028">[pg 028]</span><a name="Pg028" id="Pg028" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
will be found to rest too exclusively on vague assumption
and unproved hypothesis. In other words, a painful apprehension
is created that their edition of <span class="tei tei-q">“The New Testament
in the original Greek”</span> will be found to partake inconveniently
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page029">[pg 029]</span><a name="Pg029" id="Pg029" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of the nature of a work of the Imagination. As
codex א proved fatal to Dr. Tischendorf, so is codex <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b</span></span> evidently
the rock on which Drs. Westcott and Hort have split.
Did it ever occur to those learned men to enquire how the
Septuagint Version of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Old</span></em> Testament has fared at the
hands of codex <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b</span></span>? They are respectfully invited to address
themselves to this very damaging enquiry.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">

which there shall be no appeal,—can the student become
aware of the hopelessness of any attempt to construct the Text
of the N. T. out of the materials which those codices exclusively
supply. Let us this time take S. Mark's account of
the healing of <span class="tei tei-q">“the paralytic borne of four”</span> (ch. ii. 1-12),—and
confront their exhibition of it, with that of the commonly
received Text. In the course of those 12 verses, (not reckoning
4 blunders and certain peculiarities of spelling,)
there will be found to be 60 variations of reading,—of which
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page031">[pg 031]</span><a name="Pg031" id="Pg031" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
55 are nothing else but depravations of the text, the result
of inattention or licentiousness. Westcott and Hort adopt
23 of these:—(18, in which א <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b</span></span> conspire to vouch for a
reading: 2, where א is unsupported by <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b</span></span>: 2, where
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b</span></span>

are supported by
neither א nor <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b</span></span>). Now, in the present instance, the <span class="tei tei-q">“five
old uncials”</span> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">cannot be</span></em> the depositories of a tradition,—whether
Western or Eastern,—because they render inconsistent
testimony <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in every verse</span></em>. It must further be admitted,
(for this is really not a question of opinion, but a plain
matter of fact,) that it is unreasonable to place confidence in
such documents. What would be thought in a Court of Law
of five witnesses, called up 47 times for examination, who
should be observed to bear contradictory testimony <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">every time</span></em>?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But the whole of the problem does not by any means lie
on the surface. All that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">appears</span></em> is that the five oldest
uncials are not trustworthy witnesses; which singly, in the
course of 12 verses separate themselves from their fellows
33 times: viz. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a</span></span>, twice;—א, 5 times;—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b</span></span>, 6 times;—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">c</span></span>, thrice;—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">d</span></span>,
17 times: and which also enter into the 11 following
combinations with one another in opposition to the ordinary
Text:—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a c</span></span>, twice;—א <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b</span></span>, 10 times;—א <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">d</span></span>, once;—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">c d</span></span>, 3 times;—א

on this last occasion, which is the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">only</span></em> time when they all 5
agree, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">they are certainly all 5 wrong</span></em>.) But this, as was observed
before, lies on the surface. On closer critical inspection, it is
further discovered that their testimony betrays the baseness of
their origin by its intrinsic worthlessness. Thus, in Mk. ii, 1,
the delicate precision of the announcement ἠκούσθη ὅτι ΕἸΣ
ΟἾΚΟΝ ἘΣΤΙ (that <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">He has gone in</span></span>”</span>), disappears from א <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b d</span></span>:—as
well as (in ver. 2) the circumstance that it became the

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page032">[pg 032]</span><a name="Pg032" id="Pg032" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
statement that the paralytic was <span class="tei tei-q">“brought to”</span> our <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Saviour</span></span>,<a id="noteref_72" name="noteref_72" href="#note_72"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">72</span></span></a>
by remarking that the thing was <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">impossible</span></em>”</span> by the ordinary
method of approach. Accordingly, his account of the expedient
resorted to by the bearers fills one entire verse (ver. 4)
of his Gospel. In the mean time, א <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b</span></span> by exhibiting (in
S. Mark ii. 3,) <span class="tei tei-q">“bringing unto Him one sick of the palsy”</span>
(φέροντες πρὸς αὐτὸν παραλυτικόν,—which is but a senseless
transposition of πρὸς αὐτόν, παραλυτικὸν φέροντες), do their
best to obliterate the exquisite significance of the second
Evangelist's method.—In the next verse, the perplexity of
the bearers, who, because they could not <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">come nigh</span></em> Him”</span>
(προσεγγίσαι αὐτῷ), unroofed the house, is lost in א <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b</span></span>,—whose
προσενέγκαι has been obtained either from Matt. ix. 2, or else
from Luke v. 18, 19 (εἰσενεγκεῖν, εἰσενέγκωσιν). <span class="tei tei-q">“The bed
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">where was</span></span> the paralytic”</span> (τὸν κράββατον ὍΠΟΥ ἮΝ ὁ παραλυτικός),
in imitation of <span class="tei tei-q">“the roof <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">where was</span></span>”</span> Jesus (τὴν
στέγην ὍΠΟΥ ἮΝ [ὁ Ἰησοῦς], which had immediately preceded),
is just one of those tasteless depravations, for which
א <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b</span></span>, and especially <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">d</span></span>, are conspicuous among manuscripts.—In
the last verse, the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">instantaneous rising</span></em> of the paralytic,
noticed by S. Mark (ἠγέρθη εὐθέως), and insisted upon by
S. Luke (<span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">and immediately he rose up</span></em> before them,”</span>—καὶ
παραχρῆμα ἀναστὰς ἐνώπιον αὐτῶν), is obliterated by
shifting εὐθέως in א <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b</span></span> and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">c</span></span> to a place where εὐθέως is not
wanted, and where its significancy disappears.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Other instances of Assimilation are conspicuous. All must
see that, in ver. 5, καὶ ἰδών (א <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b c</span></span>) is derived from Matt. ix. 2
and Luke v. 20: as well as that <span class="tei tei-q">“Son, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">be of good cheer</span></em>”</span> (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">c</span></span>) is
imported hither from Matt. ix. 2. <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">My</span></em> son,”</span> on the other hand
(א), is a mere effort of the imagination. In the same verse,
σου αἱ ἁμαρτίαι (א <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b d</span></span>) is either from Matt. ix. 5 (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">sic</span></span>); or
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page033">[pg 033]</span><a name="Pg033" id="Pg033" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
else from ver. 9, lower down in S. Mark's narrative. Λέγοντες,
in ver. 6 (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">d</span></span>), is from S. Luke v. 21. Ὕπαγε (א) in ver. 9, and
ὕπαγε εἰς τὸν οἶκόν σου (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">d</span></span>), are clearly importations from
ver 11. The strange confusion in ver. 7,—<span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Because this man
thus speaketh, he blasphemeth</span></em>”</span> (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b</span></span>),—and <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Why doth this man
thus speak? He blasphemeth</span></em>”</span> (א <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">d</span></span>),—is due solely to Mtt. ix. 3:—while
the appendix proposed by א as a substitute for <span class="tei tei-q">“We
never saw it on this fashion”</span> (οὐδέποτε οὕτως εἴδομεν), in
ver 12 (viz. <span class="tei tei-q">“It was never so seen in Israel,”</span> οὐδέποτε οὕτως
ἐφάνη ἐν τῷ Ἰσραήλ), has been transplanted hither from
S. Matt. ix. 33.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We shall perhaps be told that, scandalously corrupt as the
text of א <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b c d</span></span> hereabouts may be, no reason has been shown
as yet for suspecting that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">heretical</span></em> depravation ever had
anything to do with such phenomena. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">That</span></em> (we answer) is
only because the writings of the early depravers and fabricators
of Gospels have universally perished. From the
slender relics of their iniquitous performances which have
survived to our time, we are sometimes able to lay our finger
on a foul blot and to say, <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">This</span></em> came from Tatian's Diatessaron;
and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">that</span></em> from Marcion's mutilated recension of the

side, transplanted by codices א <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b c</span></span> from S. John xix. 34 into
S. Matt, xxvii. 49, is an instance of the former,—which it
may reasonably create astonishment to find that Drs. Westcott
and Hort (<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">alone among Editors</span></em>) have nevertheless
admitted into their text, as equally trustworthy with the last
12 verses of S. Mark's Gospel. But it occasions a stronger
sentiment than surprise to discover that this, <span class="tei tei-q">“the gravest
interpolation yet laid to the charge of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b</span></span>,”</span>—this <span class="tei tei-q">“sentence
which neither they nor any other competent scholar can
possibly believe that the Evangelist ever wrote,”</span><a id="noteref_73" name="noteref_73" href="#note_73"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">73</span></span></a>—has been

S. Matthew xxvii. 49. Were not the Revisionists aware that
such a disfigurement must prove fatal to their work? <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">For

</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
An instructive specimen of depravation follows, which can
be traced to Marcion's mutilated recension of S. Luke's
Gospel. We venture to entreat the favour of the reader's
sustained attention to the license with which the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord's</span></span>
Prayer as given in S. Luke's Gospel (xi. 2-4), is exhibited by
codices א <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a b c d</span></span>. For every reason one would have expected
that so precious a formula would have been found enshrined
in the <span class="tei tei-q">“old uncials”</span> in peculiar safety; handled by copyists
of the IVth, Vth, and VIth centuries with peculiar reverence.
Let us ascertain exactly what has befallen it:—

So then, these five <span class="tei tei-q">“first-class authorities”</span> are found to
throw themselves into <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">six different combinations</span></em> in their
departures from S. Luke's way of exhibiting the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord's</span></span>
Prayer,—which, among them, they contrive to falsify in
respect of no less than 45 words; and yet <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">they are never able
to agree among themselves as to any single various reading:</span></em>
while <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">only once</span></em> are more than two of them observed to stand
together,—viz. in the unauthorized omission of the article.
In respect of 32 (out of the 45) words, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">they bear in turn solitary
evidence</span></em>. What need to declare that it is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">certainly false</span></em>
in every instance? Such however is the infatuation of the
Critics, that the vagaries of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b</span></span>are all taken for gospel. Besides
omitting the 11 words which <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b</span></span> omits jointly with א, Drs. Westcott
and Hort erase from the Book of Life those other 11
precious words which are omitted by <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b</span></span> only. And in this
way it comes to pass that the mutilated condition to which
the scalpel of Marcion the heretic reduced the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord's</span></span> Prayer
some 1730 years ago,<a id="noteref_74" name="noteref_74" href="#note_74"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">74</span></span></a> (for the mischief can all be traced back

what we hold to be the gravest blot of all, viz. the marks

But now,—For the use of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">whom</span></em> has this piece of information
been volunteered? Not for learned readers certainly:
it being familiarly known to all, that codices <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b</span></span> and א <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">alone of
manuscripts</span></em> (to their own effectual condemnation) omit these
12 verses. But then scholars know something more about
the matter. They also know that these 12 verses have been
made the subject of a separate treatise extending to upwards
of 300 pages,—which treatise has now been before the world
for a full decade of years, and for the best of reasons has
never yet been answered. Its object, stated on its title-page,
was to vindicate against recent critical objectors, and to

then be right (we respectfully enquire) still to insinuate into

The question arises,—But how did it come to pass that
such evil counsels were allowed to prevail in the Jerusalem
Chamber? Light has been thrown on the subject by two
of the New Test. company. And first by the learned Congregationalist,
Dr. Newth, who has been at the pains to
describe the method which was pursued on every occasion.
The practice (he informs us) was as follows. The Bishop of
Gloucester and Bristol, as chairman, asks—

The duty of stating this evidence is by tacit consent devolved
upon (</span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">sic</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%">) two members of the Company, who from their previous

prepared to enumerate particularly the authorities on either

Sir Edmund Beckett remarks that if the description above

appeared to me so strange,”</span> (writes the learned and judicious
Editor of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Speaker's Commentary</span></span>,) <span class="tei tei-q">“that I fully expected

vouches emphatically for their <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">genuineness</span></em>: that Severus does

<span class="tei tei-q">“testifies that these verses were not written by S. Mark.”</span> So
far from it, Eusebius actually <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">quotes the verses</span></em>, quotes them

Roberts is assured that an amount of external authority
has been accumulated which is simply overwhelming in
discussions of this nature.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But the significance of a single feature of the Lectionary,
of which up to this point nothing has been said, is alone
sufficient to determine the controversy. We refer to the fact
that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in every part of Eastern Christendom</span></em> these same 12 verses—neither
more nor less—have been from the earliest recorded

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b</span></span>) A more grievous perversion of the truth of Scripture
is scarcely to be found than occurs in the proposed revised
exhibition of S. Luke ii. 14, in the Greek and English alike;
for indeed not only is the proposed Greek text (ἐν ἀνθρώποις
εὐδοκίας) impossible, but the English of the Revisionists
(<span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">peace among men in whom he is well pleased</span></span>”</span>) <span class="tei tei-q">“can be
arrived at”</span> (as one of themselves has justly remarked) <span class="tei tei-q">“only
through some process which would make any phrase bear
almost any meaning the translator might like to put upon
it.”</span><a id="noteref_88" name="noteref_88" href="#note_88"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">88</span></span></a> More than that: the harmony of the exquisite three-part
hymn, which the Angels sang on the night of the
Nativity, becomes hopelessly marred, and its structural symmetry
destroyed, by the welding of the second and third
members of the sentence into one. Singular to relate, the
addition of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">a single final letter</span></em> (ς) has done all this mischief.
Quite as singular is it that we should be able at the end
of upwards of 1700 years to discover what occasioned its
calamitous insertion. From the archetypal copy, by the aid
of which the old Latin translation was made, (for the Latin
copies <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">all</span></em> read <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">pax hominibus bonæ voluntatis</span></span>,”</span>) the preposition
ἐν was evidently away,—absorbed apparently by the ἀν
which immediately follows. In order therefore to make a
sentence of some sort out of words which, without ἐν, are
simply unintelligible, εὐδοκία was turned into εὐδοκίας. It
is accordingly a significant circumstance that, whereas there
exists <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">no</span></em> Greek copy of the Gospels which <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">omits</span></em> the ἐν, there
is scarcely a Latin exhibition of the place to be found which
contains it.<a id="noteref_89" name="noteref_89" href="#note_89"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">89</span></span></a> To return however to the genuine clause,—<span class="tei tei-q">“Good-will
towards men”</span> (ἐν ἀνθρώποις εὐδοκία).
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page042">[pg 042]</span><a name="Pg042" id="Pg042" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Absolutely decisive of the true reading of the passage—irrespectively
of internal considerations—ought to be the
consideration that it is vouched for <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">by every known copy</span></em> of
the Gospels of whatever sort, excepting only א <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a b d</span></span>: the
first and third of which, however, were anciently corrected
and brought into conformity with the Received Text; while
the second (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a</span></span>) is observed to be so inconstant in its testimony,
that in the primitive <span class="tei tei-q">“Morning-hymn”</span> (given in
another page of the same codex, and containing a quotation
of S. Luke ii. 14), the correct reading of the place is found.
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">d</span></span>'s complicity in error is the less important, because of the
ascertained sympathy between that codex and the Latin.
In the meantime the two Syriac Versions are a full set-off
against the Latin copies; while the hostile evidence of the
Gothic (which this time sides with the Latin) is more than
neutralized by the unexpected desertion of the Coptic version
from the opposite camp. The Armenian, Georgian, Æthiopic,
Slavonic and Arabian versions, are besides all with the
Received Text. It therefore comes to this:—We are invited
to make our election between every other copy of the
Gospels,—every known Lectionary,—and (not least of all)
the ascertained ecclesiastical usage of the Eastern Church
from the beginning,—on the one hand: and the testimony of
four Codices without a history or a character, which concur
in upholding a patent mistake, on the other. Will any one
hesitate as to which of these two parties has the stronger
claim on his allegiance?

have come back to testify to the men of this generation that
the commonly received reading of S. Luke ii. 14 is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the true

Enough and to spare has now been offered concerning
the true reading of S. Luke ii. 14. But because we propose
to ourselves that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">no uncertainty whatever</span></em> shall remain on
this subject, it will not be wasted labour if at parting we
pour into the ruined citadel just enough of shot and shell to
leave no dark corner standing for the ghost of a respectable
doubt hereafter to hide in. Now, it is confessedly nothing
else but the high estimate which Critics have conceived of
the value of the testimony of the old uncials (א <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a b c d</span></span>),
which has occasioned any doubt at all to exist in this behalf.
Let the learned Reader then ascertain for himself the
character of codices א <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a b c d</span></span> hereabouts, by collating <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the
context in which S. Luke ii. 14 is found</span></em>, viz. the 13 verses
which precede and the one verse (ver. 15) which immediately
follows. If the old uncials are observed all to sing in tune
throughout, hereabouts, well and good: but if on the contrary,
their voices prove utterly discordant, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">who</span></em> sees not that
the last pretence has been taken away for placing <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">any confidence
at all</span></em> in their testimony concerning the text of
ver. 14, turning as it does on the presence or absence of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">a
single letter</span></em>?... He will find, as the result of his analysis,
that within the space of those 14 verses, the old uncials are
responsible for 56 <span class="tei tei-q">“various readings”</span> (so-called): singly, for
41; in combination with one another, for 15. So diverse,
however, is the testimony they respectively render, that they
are found severally to differ from the Text of the cursives no
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page047">[pg 047]</span><a name="Pg047" id="Pg047" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
less than 70 times. Among them, besides twice varying the
phrase,—they contrive to omit 19 words:—to add 4:—to
substitute 17:—to alter 10:—to transpose 24.—Lastly, these
five codices are observed (within the same narrow limits) to
fall into <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ten</span></em> different combinations: viz. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b</span></span> א, for 5 readings;—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b

what show of reason can the unintelligible εὐδοκίας

body of Manuscripts</span></em>, uncial and cursive,—the great bulk of
the Versions,—and the mighty array of (upwards of fifty)
Fathers exhibited above?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">c</span></span>) We are at last able to proceed, with a promise that
we shall rarely prove so tedious again. But it is absolutely
necessary to begin by clearing the ground. We may not
go on doubting for ever. The <span class="tei tei-q">“Angelic hymn”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“The
last 12 Verses”</span> of S. Mark's Gospel, are convenient places
for a trial of strength. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">It has now been proved</span></em> that the commonly
received text of S. Luke ii. 14 is the true text,—the
Revisionists' emendation of the place, a palpable mistake.
On behalf of the second Gospel, we claim to have also
established that an important portion of the sacred narrative
has been unjustly branded with a note of ignominy; from
which we solemnly call upon the Revisionists to set the
Evangelist free. The pretence that no harm has been done
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page048">[pg 048]</span><a name="Pg048" id="Pg048" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
him by the mere statement of what is an undeniable fact,—(viz.
that <span class="tei tei-q">“the two oldest Greek manuscripts, and some other
authorities, omit from verse 9 to the end;”</span> and that <span class="tei tei-q">“some
other authorities have a different ending to the Gospel,”</span>)—will
not stand examination. Pin to the shoulder of an
honourable man a hearsay libel on his character, and see
what he will have to say to you! Besides,—<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Why have the
12 verses been further separated off from the rest of the Gospel?</span></em>
This at least is unjustifiable.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Those who, with Drs. Roberts and Milligan,<a id="noteref_131" name="noteref_131" href="#note_131"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">131</span></span></a> have been
taught to maintain <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">that the passage is not the immediate
production of S. Mark</span></em>,”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">can hardly be regarded as a part
of the original Gospel</span></em>; but is rather an addition made to
it at a very early age, whether in the lifetime of the
Evangelist or not, it is impossible to say:”</span>—such Critics are
informed that they stultify themselves when they proceed
in the same breath to assure the offended reader that the
passage <span class="tei tei-q">“is nevertheless <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">possessed of full canonical authority</span></em>.”</span><a id="noteref_132" name="noteref_132" href="#note_132"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">132</span></span></a>
Men who so write show that they do not understand the
question. For if these 12 verses <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">are</span></em> <span class="tei tei-q">“canonical Scripture,”</span>—as
much inspired as the 12 verses which precede them, and
as worthy of undoubting confidence,—then, whether they be
<span class="tei tei-q">“the production of S. Mark,”</span> or of some other, is a purely
irrelevant circumstance. The <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Authorship</span></em> of the passage, as
every one must see, is not the question. The last 12 verses
of Deuteronomy, for instance, were probably not written by
Moses. Do we therefore separate them off from the rest of
Deuteronomy, and encumber the margin with a note expressive
of our opinion? Our Revisionists, so far from holding
what follows to be <span class="tei tei-q">“canonical Scripture,”</span> are careful to state
that a rival ending to be found elsewhere merits serious
attention. S. Mark xvi. 9-20, therefore (<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">according to them</span></em>),
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page049">[pg 049]</span><a name="Pg049" id="Pg049" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">not certainly</span></em> a genuine part of the Gospel; <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">may</span></em>, after all,
be nothing else but a spurious accretion to the text. And as
long as such doubts are put forth by our Revisionists, they
publish to the world that, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in their account</span></em> at all events,
these verses are <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">not</span></em> <span class="tei tei-q">“possessed of full canonical authority.”</span>
If <span class="tei tei-q">“the two oldest Greek manuscripts”</span> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">justly</span></em> <span class="tei tei-q">“omit from
verse 9 to the end”</span> (as stated in the margin), will any one
deny that our printed Text ought to omit them also?<a id="noteref_133" name="noteref_133" href="#note_133"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">133</span></span></a> On
the other hand, if the circumstance is a mere literary
curiosity, will any one maintain that it is entitled to
abiding record in the margin of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">English Version</span></em> of the
everlasting page?—<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">affords any warrant whatever for separating
</span><span class="tei tei-q">“the last Twelve Verses”</span><span style="font-style: italic"> from their context</span></em>?

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">d</span></span>) We can probably render ordinary readers no more
effectual service, than by offering now to guide them over
a few select places, concerning the true reading of which
the Revisionists either entertain such serious doubts that
they have <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">recorded</span></em> their uncertainty in the margin of their
work; or else, entertaining no doubts at all, have deliberately
thrust a new reading into the body of their text, and
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">that</span></em>, without explanation, apology, or indeed record of any
kind.<a id="noteref_134" name="noteref_134" href="#note_134"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">134</span></span></a> One remark should be premised, viz. that <span class="tei tei-q">“various
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page050">[pg 050]</span><a name="Pg050" id="Pg050" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Readings”</span> as they are (often most unreasonably) called, are
seldom if ever the result of conscious <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">fraud</span></em>. An immense
number are to be ascribed to sheer accident. It was through
erroneous judgment, we repeat, not with evil intent, that
men took liberties with the deposit. They imported into
their copies whatever readings they considered highly recommended.
By some of these ancient Critics it seems to have
been thought allowable <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">to abbreviate</span></em>, by simply leaving out
whatever did not appear to themselves strictly necessary:
by others, to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">transpose</span></em> the words—even the members—of a
sentence, almost to any extent: by others, to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">substitute</span></em> easy
expressions for difficult ones. In this way it comes to pass
that we are often presented, and in the oldest documents of
all, with Readings which stand self-condemned; are clearly
fabrications. That it was held allowable to assimilate one
Gospel to another, is quite certain. Add, that as early as
the IInd century there abounded in the Church documents,—<span class="tei tei-q">“Diatessarons”</span>
they were sometimes called,—of which the
avowed object was to weave one continuous and connected
narrative <span class="tei tei-q">“out of the four;”</span>—and we shall find that as many
heads have been provided, as will suffice for the classification
of almost every various reading which we are likely to
encounter in our study of the Gospels.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">To accidental causes</span></span> then we give the foremost place,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page051">[pg 051]</span><a name="Pg051" id="Pg051" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and of these we have already furnished the reader with two
notable and altogether dissimilar specimens. The first (viz.
the omission of S. Mark xvi. 9-20 from certain ancient copies
of the Gospel) seems to have originated in an unique circumstance.
According to the Western order of the four, S. Mark
occupies <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the last</span></em> place. From the earliest period it had been
customary to write τέλος (<span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">end</span></span>”</span>) after the 8th verse of
his last chapter, in token that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">there</span></em> a famous ecclesiastical
lection comes to a close. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Let the last leaf of one very ancient
archetypal copy have begun at ver. 9; and let that last leaf
have perished;—and all is plain.</span></em> A faithful copyist will
have ended the Gospel perforce—as <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b</span></span> and א have done—at
S. Mark xvi. 8.... Our other example (S. Luke ii. 14)
will have resulted from an accident of the most ordinary
description,—as was explained at the outset.—To the foregoing,
a few other specimens of erroneous readings resulting
from Accident shall now be added.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">a</span></span>) Always instructive, it is sometimes even entertaining
to trace the history of a mistake which, dating from the IInd
or IIIrd century, has remained without a patron all down the
subsequent ages, until at last it has been suddenly taken
up in our own times by an Editor of the sacred Text, and
straightway palmed off upon an unlearned generation as
the genuine work of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Holy Ghost</span></span>. Thus, whereas the
Church has hitherto supposed that S. Paul's company <span class="tei tei-q">“were
in all in the ship <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">two hundred threescore and sixteen souls</span></em>”</span>
(Acts xxvii. 37), Drs. Westcott and Hort (relying on the
authority of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b</span></span> and the Sahidic version) insist that what S.
Luke actually wrote was <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">about seventy-six</span></em>.”</span> In other words,
instead of διακόσιαι ἑβδομηκονταέξ, we are invited henceforth
to read ὩΣ ἑβδομηκονταέξ. What can have given rise
to so formidable a discrepancy? Mere accident, we answer.
First, whereas S. Luke certainly wrote ἦμεν δὲ ἐν τῷ πλοίῳ
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page052">[pg 052]</span><a name="Pg052" id="Pg052" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
αἱ πᾶσαι ψυχαί, his last six words at some very early period
underwent the familiar process of Transposition, and became,
αἱ πᾶσαι ψυχαὶ ἐν τῷ πλοίῳ; whereby the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">word</span></em> πλοίῳ and
the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">numbers</span></em> διακόσιαι ἑβδομηκονταέξ were brought into
close proximity. (It is thus that Lachmann, Tischendorf,
Tregelles, &amp;c., wrongly exhibit the place.) But since <span class="tei tei-q">“276”</span>
when represented in Greek numerals is ΣΟΣ, the inevitable
consequence was that the words (written in uncials) ran
thus: ΨΥΧΑΙΕΝΤΩΠΛΟΙΩΣΟΣ. Behold, the secret is out! Who
sees not what has happened? There has been no intentional
falsification of the text. There has been no critical disinclination
to believe that <span class="tei tei-q">“a corn-ship, presumably heavily
laden, would contain so many souls,”</span>—as an excellent judge
supposes.<a id="noteref_135" name="noteref_135" href="#note_135"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">135</span></span></a> The discrepancy has been the result of sheer
accident: is the merest blunder. Some IInd-century copyist
connected the last letter of ΠΛΟΙΩ with the next ensuing
numeral, which stands for 200 (viz. Σ); and made an <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">independent
word</span></em> of it, viz. ὡς—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> <span class="tei tei-q">“about.”</span> But when Σ (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>
200) has been taken away from ΣΟΣ (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> 276), 76 is perforce
all that remains. In other words, the result of so
slight a blunder has been that instead of <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">two hundred</span></em> and
seventy-six”</span> (ΣΟΣ), some one wrote ὡς ος´—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">about</span></em>
seventy-six.”</span> His blunder would have been diverting had
it been confined to the pages of a codex which is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">full</span></em> of
blunders. When however it is adopted by the latest Editors
of the N. T. (Drs. Westcott and Hort),—and by their influence
has been foisted into the margin of our revised English
Version—it becomes high time that we should reclaim
against such a gratuitous depravation of Scripture.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
All this ought not to have required explaining: the
blunder is so gross,—its history so patent. But surely, had
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page053">[pg 053]</span><a name="Pg053" id="Pg053" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
its origin been ever so obscure, the most elementary critical
knowledge joined to a little mother-wit ought to convince
a man that the reading ὡς ἑβδομηκονταέξ <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">cannot</span></em> be trustworthy.
A reading discoverable only in codex <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b</span></span> and one
Egyptian version (which was evidently executed from codices
of the same corrupt type as codex <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b</span></span>) <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">may always be dismissed
as certainly spurious</span></em>. But further,—Although a man might
of course say <span class="tei tei-q">“about <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">seventy</span></em>”</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">“about <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">eighty</span></em>,”</span> (which is how
Epiphanius<a id="noteref_136" name="noteref_136" href="#note_136"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">136</span></span></a> quotes the place,) <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">who</span></em> sees not that <span class="tei tei-q">“about
seventy-<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">six</span></em>”</span> is an impossible expression? Lastly, the two
false witnesses give divergent testimony even while they
seem to be at one: for the Sahidic (or Thebaic) version

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">b</span></span>) Another corruption of the text, with which it is
proposed henceforth to disfigure our Authorized Version,
(originating like the last in sheer accident,) occurs in Acts
xviii. 7. It is related concerning S. Paul, at Corinth, that
having forsaken the synagogue of the Jews, <span class="tei tei-q">“he entered into
a certain man's house <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">named Justus</span></em>”</span> (ὀνόματι Ἰούστου).
That this is what S. Luke wrote, is to be inferred from the
fact that it is found in almost every known copy of the Acts,
beginning with <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a d g h l p</span></span>. Chrysostom—the only ancient
Greek Father who quotes the place—<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">so</span></em> quotes it. This is,
in consequence, the reading of Lachmann, Tregelles, and
Tischendorf in his 7th edition. But then, the last syllable
of <span class="tei tei-q">“name”</span> (ΟΝΟΜΑΤΙ) and the first three letters of <span class="tei tei-q">“Justus”</span>
(ΙΟΥΣΤΟΥ), in an uncial copy, may easily get mistaken for
an independent word. Indeed it only wants a horizontal
stroke (at the summit of the second Ι in ΤΙΙΟΥ) to produce
<span class="tei tei-q">“Titus”</span> (ΤΙΤΟΥ). In the Syriac and Sahidic versions accordingly,
<span class="tei tei-q">“Titus”</span> actually stands <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in place of</span></em> <span class="tei tei-q">“Justus,”</span>—a reading
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page054">[pg 054]</span><a name="Pg054" id="Pg054" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
no longer discoverable in any extant codex. As a matter of
fact, the error resulted <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">not</span></em> in the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">substitution</span></em> of <span class="tei tei-q">“Titus”</span> for
<span class="tei tei-q">“Justus,”</span> but in the introduction of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">both</span></em> names where
S. Luke wrote but one. א and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">e</span></span>, the Vulgate, and the
Coptic version, exhibit <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Titus Justus</span></em>.”</span> And that the foregoing
is a true account of the birth and parentage of <span class="tei tei-q">“Titus”</span>
is proved by the tell-tale circumstance, that in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b</span></span> the letters
ΤΙ and ΙΟΥ are all religiously retained, and a supernumerary
letter (Τ) has been thrust in between,—the result of which
is to give us one more imaginary gentleman, viz. <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Titius</span></em>
Justus;”</span> with whose appearance,—(and he is found <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">nowhere</span></em>
but in codex <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b</span></span>,)—Tischendorf in his 8th ed., with Westcott
and Hort in theirs, are so captivated, that they actually give
him a place in their text. It was out of compassion (we
presume) for the friendless stranger <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Titus</span></em> Justus”</span> that our
Revisionists have, in preference, promoted <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">him</span></em> to honour: in
which act of humanity they stand alone. Their <span class="tei tei-q">“new Greek
Text”</span> is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the only one in existence</span></em> in which the imaginary
foreigner has been advanced to citizenship, and assigned <span class="tei tei-q">“a
local habitation and a name.”</span> ... Those must have been
wondrous drowsy days in the Jerusalem Chamber when
such manipulations of the inspired text were possible!
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">c</span></span>) The two foregoing depravations grew out of the
ancient practice of writing the Scriptures in uncial characters
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> in capital letters), no space being interposed
between the words. Another striking instance is supplied
by S. Matthew xi. 23 and S. Luke x. 15, where however the
error is so transparent that the wonder is how it can ever
have imposed upon any one. What makes the matter
serious is, that it gives a turn to a certain Divine saying,
of which it is incredible that either our <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Saviour</span></span> or His
Evangelists knew anything. We have hitherto believed that
the solemn words ran as follows:—<span class="tei tei-q">“And thou, Capernaum,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page055">[pg 055]</span><a name="Pg055" id="Pg055" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
which art exalted (ἡ ... ὑψωθεῖσα) unto heaven, shalt be
brought down (καταβιβασθήσῃ) to hell.”</span> For this, our Revisionists
invite us to substitute, in S. Luke as well as in
S. Matthew,—<span class="tei tei-q">“And thou, Capernaum, shalt thou be exalted
(μὴ ... ὑψωθήσῃ;) unto heaven?”</span> And then, in S. Matthew,
(but not in S. Luke,)—<span class="tei tei-q">“Thou shalt go down (καταβήσῃ)
into Hades.”</span> Now, what can have happened to occasion
such a curious perversion of our <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord's</span></span> true utterance, and
to cause Him to ask an unmeaning <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">question</span></em> about the future,
when He was clearly announcing a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">fact</span></em>, founded on the
history of the past?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A stupid blunder has been made (we answer), of which
traces survive (as usual) only in the same little handful of
suspicious documents. The final letter of Capernaum (Μ) by
cleaving to the next ensuing letter (Η) has made an independent
word (ΜΗ); which new word necessitates a change
in the construction, and causes the sentence to become interrogative.
And yet, fourteen of the uncial manuscripts and the
whole body of the cursives know nothing of this: neither does
the Peschito—nor the Gothic version: no,—nor Chrysostom,—nor
Cyril,—nor ps.-Cæsarius,—nor Theodoret,—the only
Fathers who quote either place. The sole witnesses for μὴ
... ὑψωθήσῃ in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">both</span></em> Gospels are א <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b</span></span>, copies of the old Latin,
Cureton's Syriac, the Coptic, and the Æthiopic versions,—a
consensus of authorities which ought to be held fatal to any
reading. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">c</span></span> joins the conspiracy in Matthew xi. 23, but not
in Luke x. 15: <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">d l</span></span> consent in Luke, but not in Matthew.
The Vulgate, which sided with א <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b</span></span> in S. Matthew, forsakes
them in S. Luke. In writing <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">both</span></em> times καταβήσῃ (<span class="tei tei-q">“thou
shalt go down”</span>), codex <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b</span></span> (forsaken this time by א) is supported
by a single manuscript, viz. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">d</span></span>. But because, in
Matthew xi. 23, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b</span></span> obtains the sanction of the Latin copies,
καταβήσῃ is actually introduced into the Revised Text, and
we are quietly informed in the margin that <span class="tei tei-q">“Many ancient
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page056">[pg 056]</span><a name="Pg056" id="Pg056" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
authorities read <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">be brought down</span></em>:”</span> the truth being (as the reader
has been made aware) that there are <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">only two manuscripts
in existence which read anything else</span></em>. And (what deserves
attention) those two manuscripts are convicted of having
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">borrowed their quotation from the Septuagint</span></em>,<a id="noteref_137" name="noteref_137" href="#note_137"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">137</span></span></a> and therefore
stand self-condemned.... Were the occupants of the Jerusalem
Chamber all—saving the two who in their published
edition insist on reading (with <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b</span></span> and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">d</span></span>) καταβήσῃ in both
places—<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">all</span></em> fast asleep when they became consenting parties
to this sad mistake?

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
II. It is time to explain that, if the most serious depravations
of Scripture are due to Accident, a vast number are
unmistakably the result of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Design</span></span>, and are very clumsily
executed too. The enumeration of a few of these may prove
instructive: and we shall begin with something which is
found in S. Mark xi. 3. With nothing perhaps will each
several instance so much impress the devout student of
Scripture, as with the exquisite structure of a narrative in
which corrupt readings stand self-revealed and self-condemned,
the instant they are ordered to come to the front and show
themselves. But the point to which we especially invite his
attention is, the sufficiency of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">external evidence</span></em> which
Divine Wisdom is observed to have invariably provided for
the establishment of the truth of His written Word.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">a</span></span>) When our <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span></span> was about to enter His capital in
lowly triumph, He is observed to have given to <span class="tei tei-q">“two of His
disciples”</span> directions well calculated to suggest the mysterious
nature of the incident which was to follow. They
were commanded to proceed to the entrance of a certain
village,—to unloose a certain colt which they would find
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page057">[pg 057]</span><a name="Pg057" id="Pg057" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
tied there,—and to bring the creature straightway to <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Jesus</span></span>.
Any obstacle which they might encounter would at once
disappear before the simple announcement that <span class="tei tei-q">“the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span></span>
hath need of him.”</span><a id="noteref_138" name="noteref_138" href="#note_138"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">138</span></span></a> But, singular to relate, this transaction
is found to have struck some third-rate IIIrd-century Critic
as not altogether correct. The good man was evidently of
opinion that the colt,—as soon as the purpose had been
accomplished for which it had been obtained,—ought in
common fairness to have been returned to <span class="tei tei-q">“the owners
thereof.”</span> (S. Luke xix. 33.) Availing himself therefore of
there being no nominative before <span class="tei tei-q">“will send”</span> (in S. Mark
xi. 3), he assumed that it was <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">of Himself</span></em> that our <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span></span> was
still speaking: feigned that the sentence is to be explained
thus:—<span class="tei tei-q">“say ye, <span class="tei tei-q">‘that the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span></span> hath need of him <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">and
will straightway send him hither</span></em>.’</span> ”</span> According to this view
of the case, our <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Saviour</span></span> instructed His two Disciples to
convey to the owner of the colt an undertaking from Himself
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">that He would send the creature back as soon as He had
done with it</span></em>: would treat the colt, in short, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">as a loan</span></em>. A
more stupid imagination one has seldom had to deal with.
But in the meantime, by way of clenching the matter, the
Critic proceeded on his own responsibility to thrust into the
text the word <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">again</span></em>”</span> (πάλιν). The fate of such an unauthorized
accretion might have been confidently predicted.
After skipping about in quest of a fixed resting-place for a
few centuries (see the note at foot<a id="noteref_139" name="noteref_139" href="#note_139"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">139</span></span></a>), πάλιν has shared the
invariable fate of all such spurious adjuncts to the truth of
Scripture, viz.: It has been effectually eliminated from the
copies. Traces of it linger on only in those untrustworthy
witnesses א <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b c d L</span></span> Δ, and about twice as many cursive
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page058">[pg 058]</span><a name="Pg058" id="Pg058" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
copies, also of depraved type. So transparent a fabrication
ought in fact to have been long since forgotten. Yet have
our Revisionists not been afraid to revive it. In S. Mark
xi. 3, they invite us henceforth to read, <span class="tei tei-q">“And if any one say
unto you, Why do ye this? say ye, The <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span></span> hath need of
him, and straightway <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">He</span></em> (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span></span>) <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">will send him</span></em> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">back</span></span>
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">hither</span></em>.”</span> ... Of what can they have been dreaming? They
cannot pretend that they have <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Antiquity</span></em> on their side: for,
besides the whole mass of copies with <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a</span></span> at their head, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">both</span></em>
the Syriac, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">both</span></em> the Latin, and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">both</span></em> the Egyptian versions,
the Gothic, the Armenian,—all in fact except the Æthiopic,—are
against them. Even Origen, who twice inserts πάλιν,<a id="noteref_140" name="noteref_140" href="#note_140"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">140</span></span></a>
twice leaves it out.<a id="noteref_141" name="noteref_141" href="#note_141"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">141</span></span></a> <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Quid plura?</span></span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">b</span></span>) No need to look elsewhere for our next instance. A
novel statement arrests attention five verses lower down:
viz. that <span class="tei tei-q">“Many spread their garments upon the way”</span> [and
why not <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in</span></em> the way”</span>? εἰς does not mean <span class="tei tei-q">“upon”</span>]; <span class="tei tei-q">“and
others, branches <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">which they had cut from the fields</span></em>”</span> (S. Mark
xi. 8). But how in the world could they have done <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">that</span></em>?
They must have been clever people certainly if they <span class="tei tei-q">“cut
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">branches</span></em> from”</span> anything except <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">trees</span></em>. Was it because our
Revisionists felt this, that in the margin they volunteer the
information, that the Greek for <span class="tei tei-q">“branches”</span> is in strictness
<span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">layers of leaves</span></em>”</span>? But what <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">are</span></em> <span class="tei tei-q">“layers of leaves”</span>? and
what <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">proof</span></em> is there that στοιβάδες has that meaning? and
how could <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">layers of leaves</span></em>”</span> have been suddenly procured
from such a quarter? We turn to our Authorized Version,
and are refreshed by the familiar and intelligible words:
<span class="tei tei-q">“And others cut down branches off the trees and strawed
them in the way.”</span> Why then has this been changed? In
an ordinary sentence, consisting of 12 words, we find that 2
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page059">[pg 059]</span><a name="Pg059" id="Pg059" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
words have been substituted for other 2; that 1 has undergone
modification; that 5 have been ejected. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Why</span></em> is all
this? asks the unlearned Reader. He shall be told.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
An instance is furnished us of the perplexity which a
difficult word sometimes occasioned the ancients, as well
as of the serious consequences which have sometimes resulted
therefrom to the text of Scripture itself. S. Matthew,
after narrating that <span class="tei tei-q">“a very great multitude spread their
garments in the way,”</span> adds, <span class="tei tei-q">“others cut branches (κλάδους)
from the trees and strawed them in the way.”</span><a id="noteref_142" name="noteref_142" href="#note_142"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">142</span></span></a> But would
not branches of any considerable size have impeded progress,
inconveniently encumbering the road? No doubt they
would. Accordingly, as S. Mark (with S. Matthew's Gospel
before him) is careful to explain, they were <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">not</span></em> <span class="tei tei-q">“branches
of any considerable size,”</span> but <span class="tei tei-q">“leafy twigs”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">foliage</span></em>,”</span> in fact
it was—<span class="tei tei-q">“cut from the trees and strawed in the way.”</span> The
word, however, which he employs (στοιβάδας) is an unique
word—very like another of similar sound (στιβάδας), yet
distinct from it in sense, if not in origin. Unfortunately,
all this was not understood in a highly uncritical and most
licentious age. With the best intentions, (for the good man
was only seeking to reconcile two inconvenient parallel
statements,) some Revisionist of the IInd century, having
convinced himself that the latter word (στιβάδας) might with
advantage take the place of S. Mark's word (στοιβάδας),
substituted this for that. In consequence, it survives to this
day in nine uncial copies headed by א <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b</span></span>. But then, στιβάς
does not mean <span class="tei tei-q">“a branch”</span> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">at all</span></em>; no, nor a <span class="tei tei-q">“layer of leaves”</span>
either; but <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">a pallet</span></em>—<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">a floor-bed</span></em>, in fact, of the humblest
type, constructed of grass, rushes, straw, brushwood, leaves,
or any similar substance. On the other hand, because such
materials are not obtainable <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">from trees</span></em> exactly, the ancient
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page060">[pg 060]</span><a name="Pg060" id="Pg060" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Critic judged it expedient further to change δένδρων into
ἀγρῶν (<span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">fields</span></em>”</span>). Even this was not altogether satisfactory.
Στιβάς, as explained already, in strictness means a <span class="tei tei-q">“bed.”</span>
Only by a certain amount of license can it be supposed to
denote the materials of which a bed is composed; whereas
the Evangelist speaks of something <span class="tei tei-q">“strawn.”</span> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">The self-same
copies</span></em>, therefore, which exhibit <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">fields</span></em>”</span> (in lieu of <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">trees</span></em>”</span>),
by introducing a slight change in the construction (κόψαντες
for ἔκοπτον), and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">omitting</span></em> the words <span class="tei tei-q">“and strawed them in
the way,”</span> are observed—after a summary fashion of their own,
(with which, however, readers of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b</span></span> א <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">d</span></span> are only too familiar)—to
dispose of this difficulty by putting it nearly out
of sight. The only result of all this misplaced officiousness
is a miserable travestie of the sacred words:—ἄλλοι δὲ στιβάδας,
κόψαντες ἐκ τῶν ἀγρῶν: 7 words in place of 12!
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But the calamitous circumstance is that the Critics have all
to a man fallen into the trap. True, that Origen (who once
writes στοιβάδας and once στιβάδας), as well as the two
Egyptian versions, side with א <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b c l</span></span> Δ in reading ἐκ τῶν
ἀγρῶν: but then <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">both versions</span></em> (with <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">c</span></span>) <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">decline to alter the
construction</span></em> of the sentence; and (with Origen) <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">decline to
omit the clause</span></em> ἐστρώννυον εἰς τὴν ὁδόν: while, against this
little band of disunited witnesses, are marshalled all the
remaining fourteen uncials, headed by <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a d</span></span>—the Peschito and
the Philoxenian Syriac; the Italic, the Vulgate, the Gothic,
the Armenian, the Georgian, and the Æthiopic as well as the
Slavonic versions, besides the whole body of the cursives.
Whether therefore Antiquity, Variety, Respectability of witnesses,
numbers, or the reason of the thing be appealed to,
the case of our opponents breaks hopelessly down. Does
any one seriously suppose that, if S. Mark had written the
common word στΙβάδας, so vast a majority of the copies at
this day would exhibit the improbable στΟΙβάδας? Had the
same S. Mark expressed nothing else but ΚΌΨΑΝΤΕΣ ἐκ τῶν
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page061">[pg 061]</span><a name="Pg061" id="Pg061" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
ἈΓΡΩ´Ν, will any one persuade us that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">every copy in existence
but five</span></em> would present us with ἜΚΟΠΤΟΝ ἐκ τῶν ΔΈΝΔΡΩΝ,
καὶ ἘΣΤΡΏΝΝΥΟΝ ἘΙΣ ΤῊΝ ὉΔΌΝ? And let us not be told that
there has been Assimilation here. There has been none.
S. Matthew (xxi. 8) writes ἈΠῸ τῶν δένδρον ... ἘΝ τῇ ὡδῷ:
S. Mark (xi. 8), ἘΚ τῶν δένδρων ... ἘΙΣ τὴν ὁδόν. The
types are distinct, and have been faithfully retained all
down the ages. The common reading is certainly correct.
The Critics are certainly in error. And we exclaim (surely
not without good reason) against the hardship of thus having
an exploded corruption of the text of Scripture furbished up
afresh and thrust upon us, after lying deservedly forgotten
for upwards of a thousand years.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">c</span></span>) Take a yet grosser specimen, which has nevertheless
imposed just as completely upon our Revisionists. It is
found in S. Luke's Gospel (xxiii. 45), and belongs to the
history of the Crucifixion. All are aware that as, at the
typical redemption out of Egypt, there had been a preternatural
darkness over the land for three days,<a id="noteref_143" name="noteref_143" href="#note_143"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">143</span></span></a> so, preliminary
to the actual Exodus of <span class="tei tei-q">“the Israel of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">God</span></span>,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“there
was darkness over all the land”</span> for three hours.<a id="noteref_144" name="noteref_144" href="#note_144"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">144</span></span></a> S. Luke
adds the further statement,—<span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">And the sun was darkened</span></em>”</span>
(καὶ ἐσκοτίσθη ὁ ἥλιος). Now the proof that this is what
S. Luke actually wrote, is the most obvious and conclusive
possible. Ἐσκοτίσθη is found in all the most ancient documents.

It is, nevertheless, well known that this place of
S. Luke's Gospel was tampered with from a very early period;
and that Origen<a id="noteref_161" name="noteref_161" href="#note_161"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">161</span></span></a> (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 186-253), and perhaps Eusebius,<a id="noteref_162" name="noteref_162" href="#note_162"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">162</span></span></a>

writes Origen, instead of <span class="tei tei-q">“and the sun was darkened”</span> (καὶ
ἐσκοτίσθη ὁ ἥλιος), is found <span class="tei tei-q">“the sun having become eclipsed”</span>
(τοῦ ἡλίου ἐκλιπόντος). He points out with truth that the
thing spoken of is a physical impossibility, and delivers it as
his opinion that the corruption of the text was due either to
some friendly hand in order to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">account for</span></em> the darkness; or
else, (which he,<a id="noteref_163" name="noteref_163" href="#note_163"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">163</span></span></a> and Jerome<a id="noteref_164" name="noteref_164" href="#note_164"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">164</span></span></a> after him, thought more
likely,) to the enemies of Revelation, who sought in this way
to provide themselves with a pretext for cavil. Either way,
Origen and Jerome elaborately assert that ἐσκοτίσθη is the
only true reading of S. Luke xxiii. 45. Will it be believed
that this gross fabrication—for no other reason but because

been resuscitated in 1881, and foisted into the sacred Text

corruption of the text arose: for (as was explained at the
outset) the reading in question (καὶ ἐσκοτίσθη ὁ ἥλιος) is found
in all the oldest and most famous documents. Our Revisionists
cannot take their stand on <span class="tei tei-q">“Antiquity,”</span>—for as we
have seen, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">all the Versions</span></em> (with the single exception of the

Julius Africanus, Hippolytus, Athanasius, Gregory Naz.,
Ephraem, &amp;c.,) are <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">all</span></em> against them.—They cannot advance
the claim of <span class="tei tei-q">“clearly preponderating evidence;”</span> for they have
but a single Version,—<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">not</span></em> a single Father,—and but three-and-a-half
Evangelia to appeal to, out of perhaps three
hundred and fifty times that number.—They cannot pretend
that essential probability is in favour of the reading of א <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b</span></span>;
seeing that the thing stated is astronomically impossible.—They
will not tell us that critical opinion is with them: for
their judgment is opposed to that of every Critic ancient and
modern, except Tischendorf since his discovery of codex א.—Of
what nature then will be their proof?... <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Nothing</span></em>
results from the discovery that א reads τοῦ ἡλίου ἐκλιπόντος,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b</span></span> ἐκλείποντος,—except that those two codices are of the same
corrupt type as those which Origen deliberately condemned
1650 years ago. In the meantime, with more of ingenuity
than of ingenuousness, our Revisionists attempt to conceal
the foolishness of the text of their choice by translating it
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page065">[pg 065]</span><a name="Pg065" id="Pg065" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
unfairly. They present us with, <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the sun's light failing</span></em>.”</span> But
this is a gloss of their own. There is no mention of <span class="tei tei-q">“the
sun's <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">light</span></em>”</span> in the Greek. Nor perhaps, if the rationale of
the original expression were accurately ascertained, would
such a paraphrase of it prove correct<a id="noteref_168" name="noteref_168" href="#note_168"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">168</span></span></a>. But, in fact, the
phrase ἔκλειψις ἡλίου means <span class="tei tei-q">“an eclipse of the sun”</span> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">no
other thing</span></em>. In like manner, τοῦ ἡλίου ἐκλείποντος<a id="noteref_169" name="noteref_169" href="#note_169"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">169</span></span></a> (as our
Revisionists are perfectly well aware) means <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the sun becoming
eclipsed</span></em>,”</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">suffering eclipse</span></em>.”</span> It is easy for Revisionists
to <span class="tei tei-q">“emphatically deny that there is anything in the Greek
word ἐκλείπειν, when associated with the sun, which involves
necessarily the notion of an eclipse.”</span><a id="noteref_170" name="noteref_170" href="#note_170"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">170</span></span></a> The <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">fact</span></em> referred to
may not be so disposed of. It lies outside the province of
<span class="tei tei-q">“emphatic denial.”</span> Let them ask any Scholar in Europe what
τοῦ ἡλίου ἐκλιπόντος means; and see if he does not tell
them that it can <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">only</span></em> mean, <span class="tei tei-q">“the sun <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">having become eclipsed</span></em>”</span>!
They know this every bit as well as their Reviewer. And
they ought either to have had the manliness to render the
words faithfully, or else the good sense to let the Greek
alone,—which they are respectfully assured was their only
proper course. Καί ἐσκοτίσθη ὁ ἥλιος is, in fact, clearly
above suspicion. Τοῦ ἡλίου ἐκλείποντος, which these learned
men (with the best intentions) have put in its place, is, to
speak plainly, a transparent fabrication. That it enjoys
<span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">clearly preponderating evidence</span></em>,”</span> is what no person, fair or
unfair, will for an instant venture to pretend.

III. Next, let us produce an instance of depravation of
Scripture resulting from the practice of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Assimilation</span></span>, which
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page066">[pg 066]</span><a name="Pg066" id="Pg066" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">a</span></span>) It occurs in S. Mark vi. 20, and is more than unsuspected.
The substitution (on the authority of א <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b l</span></span> and
the Coptic) of ἠπόρει for ἐποίει in that verse, (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> the statement
that Herod <span class="tei tei-q">“was much <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">perplexed</span></em>,”</span>—instead of Herod
<span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">did</span></em> many things,”</span>) is even vaunted by the Critics as the
recovery of the true reading of the place—long obscured by
the <span class="tei tei-q">“very singular expression”</span> ἐποίει. To ourselves the only
<span class="tei tei-q">“very singular”</span> thing is, how men of first-rate ability can
fail to see that, on the contrary, the proposed substitute is
simply fatal to the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Spirit's</span></span> teaching in this place. <span class="tei tei-q">“Common
sense is staggered by such a rendering,”</span> (remarks the learned
Bishop of Lincoln). <span class="tei tei-q">“People are not wont to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">hear gladly</span></em>

sacred writer's object clearly is, to record the striking circumstance
that Herod was so moved by the discourses of
John, (whom he used to <span class="tei tei-q">“listen to with pleasure,”</span>) that he
even <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">did many things</span></em>”</span> (πολλὰ ἐποίει) <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in conformity with

shall be asked) has <span class="tei tei-q">“he was much perplexed”</span> (πολλὰ ἠπόρει)
contrived to effect a lodgment in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">so many as three</span></em> copies of
the second Gospel?

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It has resulted from nothing else, we reply, but the determination
to assimilate a statement of S. Mark (vi. 20) concerning
Herod and John the Baptist, with another and a distinct
statement of S. Luke (ix. 7), having reference to Herod
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page067">[pg 067]</span><a name="Pg067" id="Pg067" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and our <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span></span>. S. Luke, speaking of the fame of our
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Saviour's</span></span> miracles at a period subsequent to the Baptist's
murder, declares that when Herod <span class="tei tei-q">“heard <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">all things that were
done</span></em> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">by Him</span></span>”</span> (ἤκουσε τὰ γινόμενα ὑπ᾽ αὐτοῦ πάντα), <span class="tei tei-q">“he <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">was

and diverse from one another as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">this</span></em> of S. Luke, and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">that</span></em>
(given above) of S. Mark, might surely (one would think)
have been let alone. On the contrary. A glance at the
foot of the page will show that in the IInd century S. Mark's
words were solicited in all sorts of ways. A persistent determination
existed to make him say that Herod having <span class="tei tei-q">“heard
of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">many things which </span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">the Baptist</span></span><span style="font-style: italic"> did</span></em>,”</span> &amp;c.<a id="noteref_173" name="noteref_173" href="#note_173"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">173</span></span></a>—a strange perversion

Had this been <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">all</span></em>, however, the matter would have
attracted no attention. One such fabrication more or less
in the Latin version, which abounds in fabricated readings,
is of little moment. But then, the Greek scribes had recourse
to a more subtle device for assimilating Mark vi. 20 to Luke
ix. 7. They perceived that S. Mark's ἐποίει might be almost
identified with S. Luke's διηπόρει, by <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">merely changing two of
the letters</span></em>, viz. by substituting η for ε and ρ for ι. From this,
there results in S. Mk. vi. 20: <span class="tei tei-q">“and having heard many things
of him, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">he was perplexed</span></em>;”</span> which is very nearly identical
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page069">[pg 069]</span><a name="Pg069" id="Pg069" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
with what is found in S. Lu. ix. 7. This fatal substitution (of
ἠπόρει for ἐποίει) survives happily only in codices א <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b l</span></span> and
the Coptic version—all of bad character. But (calamitous to
relate) the Critics, having disinterred this long-since-forgotten
fabrication, are making vigorous efforts to galvanize it, at the
end of fifteen centuries, into ghastly life and activity. We
venture to assure them that they will not succeed. Herod's
<span class="tei tei-q">“perplexity”</span> did not begin until John had been beheaded,
and the fame reached Herod of the miracles which our
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Saviour</span></span> wrought. The apocryphal statement, now for the
first time thrust into an English copy of the New Testament,
may be summarily dismissed. But the marvel will for ever
remain that a company of distinguished Scholars (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1881)
could so effectually persuade themselves that ἐποίει (in
S. Mark vi. 20) is a <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">plain and clear error</span></em>,”</span> and that there is
<span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">decidedly preponderating evidence</span></em>”</span> in favour of ἠπόρει,—as to
venture to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">substitute the latter word for the former</span></em>. This
will for ever remain a marvel, we say; seeing that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">all the
uncials</span></em> except three of bad character, together with <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">every
known cursive without exception</span></em>;—the old Latin and the
Vulgate, the Peschito and the Philoxenian Syriac, the Armenian,
Æthiopic, Slavonian and Georgian versions,—are with
the traditional Text. (The Thebaic, the Gothic, and Cureton's
Syriac are defective here. The ancient Fathers are silent.)

IV. More serious in its consequences, however, than any
other source of mischief which can be named, is the process
of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Mutilation</span></span>, to which, from the beginning, the Text of
Scripture has been subjected. By the <span class="tei tei-q">“Mutilation”</span> of Scripture
we do but mean the intentional Omission—<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">from whatever
cause proceeding</span></em>—of genuine portions. And the causes of it
have been numerous as well as diverse. Often, indeed,
there seems to have been at work nothing else but a
strange passion for getting rid of whatever portions of the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page070">[pg 070]</span><a name="Pg070" id="Pg070" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
inspired Text have seemed to anybody superfluous,—or at
all events have appeared capable of being removed without
manifest injury to the sense. But the estimate of the
tasteless IInd-century Critic will never be that of the well-informed
Reader, furnished with the ordinary instincts of
piety and reverence. This barbarous mutilation of the
Gospel, by the unceremonious excision of a multitude of
little words, is often attended by no worse consequence than
that thereby an extraordinary baldness is imparted to the
Evangelical narrative. The removal of so many of the
coupling-hooks is apt to cause the curtains of the Tabernacle
to hang wondrous ungracefully; but often <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">that</span></em> is all. Sometimes,
however, (as might have been confidently anticipated,)
the result is calamitous in a high degree. Not only is the
beauty of the narrative effectually marred, (as <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">e.g.</span></span> by the
barbarous excision of καί—εὐθέως—μετὰ δακρύων—Κύριε,

by the omission of καὶ νηστείᾳ from verse 29):—absurd expressions
attributed to the Holy One which He certainly
never uttered, (as <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">e.g.</span></span> by truncating of its last word the
phrase τό, Εἰ δύνασαι πιστεῦσαι in verse 23):—but (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">i.</span></span>) The
narrative is often rendered in a manner unintelligible; or
else (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">ii.</span></span>), The entire point of a precious incident is made to
disappear from sight; or else (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">iii.</span></span>), An imaginary incident
is fabricated: or lastly (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">iv.</span></span>), Some precious saying of our
Divine <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span></span> is turned into absolute nonsense. Take a

of the Gospels in turn.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">i.</span></span>) In S. Matthew xiv. 30, we are invited henceforth to
submit to the information concerning Simon Peter, that
<span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">when he saw the wind</span></em>, he was afraid.”</span> The sight must have
been peculiar, certainly. So, indeed, is the expression. But
Simon Peter was as unconscious of the one as S. Matthew of
the other. Such curiosities are the peculiar property of
codices א <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b</span></span>—the Coptic version—and the Revisionists. The
predicate of the proposition (viz. <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">that it was strong</span></em>,”</span> contained
in the single word ἰσχυρόν) has been wantonly excised.
That is all!—although Dr. Hort succeeded in persuading his
colleagues to the contrary. A more solemn—a far sadder
instance, awaits us in the next Gospel.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">ii.</span></span>) The first three Evangelists are careful to note <span class="tei tei-q">“the
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">loud</span></em> cry”</span> with which the Redeemer of the World expired.
But it was reserved for S. Mark (as Chrysostom pointed out
long since) to record (xv. 39) the memorable circumstance
that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">this particular portent</span></em> it was, which wrought conviction
in the soul of the Roman soldier whose office it was to be
present on that terrible occasion. The man had often witnessed
death by Crucifixion, and must have been well
acquainted with its ordinary phenomena. Never before had
he witnessed anything like this. He was stationed where he
could see and hear all that happened: <span class="tei tei-q">“standing”</span> (S. Mark
says) <span class="tei tei-q">“near”</span> our <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Saviour</span></span>,—<span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">over against Him</span></em>.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Now, when
the Centurion saw that it was <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">after so crying out</span></em> (κράξας),
that He expired”</span> (xv. 39) he uttered the memorable words,
<span class="tei tei-q">“Truly this man <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">was</span></em> the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Son of God</span></span>!”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“What chiefly
moved him to make that confession of his faith was that our
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Saviour</span></span> evidently died <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">with power</span></em>.”</span><a id="noteref_176" name="noteref_176" href="#note_176"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">176</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-q">“The miracle”</span> (says
Bp. Pearson) <span class="tei tei-q">“was not in the death, but <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in the voice</span></em>. The
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page072">[pg 072]</span><a name="Pg072" id="Pg072" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
strangeness was not that He should die, but that at the point
of death He should <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">cry out so loud</span></em>. He died not by, but
with a Miracle.”</span><a id="noteref_177" name="noteref_177" href="#note_177"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">177</span></span></a> ... All this however is lost in א <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b l</span></span>, which
literally <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">stand alone</span></em><a id="noteref_178" name="noteref_178" href="#note_178"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">178</span></span></a> in leaving out the central and only
important word, κράξας. Calamitous to relate, they are followed
herein by our Revisionists: who (misled by Dr. Hort)
invite us henceforth to read,—<span class="tei tei-q">“Now when the Centurion saw
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">that He so gave up the ghost</span></em>.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">iii.</span></span>) In S. Luke xxiii. 42, by leaving out two little words
(τω and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="text-decoration: underline">κε</span></span>), the same blind guides, under the same blind
guidance, effectually misrepresent the record concerning the
repentant malefactor. Henceforth they would have us believe
that <span class="tei tei-q">“he said, <span class="tei tei-q">‘<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Jesus</span></span>, remember me when thou comest
in thy Kingdom.’</span> ”</span> (Dr. Hort was fortunately unable to persuade
the Revisionists to follow him in further substituting
<span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">into</span></em> thy kingdom”</span> for <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in</span></em> thy kingdom;”</span> and so converting
what, in the A. V., is nothing worse than a palpable mistranslation,<a id="noteref_179" name="noteref_179" href="#note_179"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">179</span></span></a>
into what would have been an indelible blot.
The record of his discomfiture survives in the margin).
Whereas none of the Churches of Christendom have ever yet
doubted that S. Luke's record is, that the dying man <span class="tei tei-q">“said
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">unto </span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Jesus</span></span></em>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span></span>, remember me,”</span> &amp;c.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">iv.</span></span>) In S. John xiv. 4, by eliminating the second καί and
the second οἴδατε, our <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Saviour</span></span> is now made to say, <span class="tei tei-q">“And
whither I go, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ye know the way</span></em>;”</span> which is really almost nonsense.
What He actually said was, <span class="tei tei-q">“And whither I go ye
know, and the way ye know;”</span> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in consequence of which</span></em> (as we
all remember) <span class="tei tei-q">“Thomas saith unto Him, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span></span>, we know

not <span class="tei tei-q">‘whither’</span> Thou goest, and how can we know <span class="tei tei-q">‘the
way’</span>?”</span> ... Let these four samples suffice of a style of depravation
with which, at the end of 1800 years, it is deliberately
proposed to disfigure every page of the everlasting Gospel;
and for which, were it tolerated, the Church would have
to thank no one so much as Drs. Westcott and Hort.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We cannot afford, however, so to dismiss the phenomena
already opened up to the Reader's notice. For indeed, this
astonishing taste for mutilating and maiming the Sacred
Deposit, is perhaps the strangest phenomenon in the history
of Textual Criticism.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is in this way that a famous expression in S. Luke vi. 1
has disappeared from codices א <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b l</span></span>. The reader may not be
displeased to listen to an anecdote which has hitherto escaped
the vigilance of the Critics:—
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“I once asked my teacher, Gregory of Nazianzus,”</span>—(the
words are Jerome's in a letter to Nepotianus),—<span class="tei tei-q">“to explain to
me the meaning of S. Luke's expression σάββατον δευτερόπρωτον,
literally the <span class="tei tei-q">‘<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">second-first</span></em> sabbath.’</span> <span class="tei tei-q">‘I will tell you
all about it in church,’</span> he replied. <span class="tei tei-q">‘The congregation
shall shout applause, and you shall have your choice,—either
to stand silent and look like a fool, or else to pretend you
understand what you do not.’</span> ”</span> But <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">eleganter lusit</span></span>,”</span> says
Jerome<a id="noteref_180" name="noteref_180" href="#note_180"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">180</span></span></a>. The point of the joke was this: Gregory, being
a great rhetorician and orator, would have descanted so
elegantly on the signification of the word δευτερόπρωτον that
the congregation would have been borne away by his mellifluous
periods, quite regardless of the sense. In other words,
Gregory of Nazianzus [<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 360] is found to have no more
understood the word than Jerome did [370].

found in the old Latin, and is retained by the Vulgate. Earlier
evidence on the subject does not exist. We venture to assume
that a word so attested must at least be entitled to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">its place in
the Gospel</span></em>. Such a body of first-rate positive IVth-century
testimony, coming from every part of ancient Christendom,
added to the significant fact that δευτερόπρωτον is found in
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">every codex extant</span></em> except א <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b l</span></span>, and half a dozen cursives of
suspicious character, ought surely to be regarded as decisive.
That an unintelligible word should have got <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">omitted</span></em> from a
few copies, requires no explanation. Every one who has
attended to the matter is aware that the negative evidence of
certain of the Versions also is of little weight on such occasions
as the present. They are observed constantly to leave
out what they either failed quite to understand, or else
found untranslateable. On the other hand, it would be inexplicable
indeed, that an unique expression like the present
should have <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">established itself universally</span></em>, if it were actually
spurious. This is precisely an occasion for calling to mind
the precept <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">proclivi scriptioni præstat ardua</span></span>. Apart from
external evidence, it is a thousand times more likely that
such a peculiar word as this should be genuine, than the reverse.
Tischendorf accordingly retains it, moved by this very
consideration.<a id="noteref_187" name="noteref_187" href="#note_187"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">187</span></span></a> It got excised, however, here and there from
manuscripts at a very early date. And, incredible as it may
appear, it is a fact, that in consequence of its absence from
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page075">[pg 075]</span><a name="Pg075" id="Pg075" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the mutilated codices above referred to, S. Luke's famous
<span class="tei tei-q">“second-first Sabbath”</span> has been <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">thrust out of his Gospel by our
Revisionists</span></em>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But indeed, Mutilation has been practised throughout.
By codex <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b</span></span> (collated with the traditional Text), no less than
2877 words have been excised from the four Gospels alone:
by codex א,—3455 words: by codex <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">d</span></span>,—3704 words.<a id="noteref_188" name="noteref_188" href="#note_188"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">188</span></span></a>

On an attentive survey of the foregoing sixteen instances
of unauthorized Omission, it will be perceived that the 1st
passage (S. Luke xxii. 19, 20) must have been eliminated
from the Text because the mention of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">two</span></em> Cups seemed to
create a difficulty.—The 2nd has been suppressed because
(see p. <a href="#Pg082" class="tei tei-ref">82</a>) the incident was deemed derogatory to the majesty
of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">God</span></span> Incarnate.—The 3rd and 5th were held to be superfluous,
because the information which they contain has been
already conveyed by the parallel passages.—The 10th will
have been omitted as apparently inconsistent with the strict
letter of S. John xx. 1-10.—The 6th and 13th are certainly
instances of enforced Harmony.—Most of the others (the
4th, 7th, 8th, 9th, 11th, 12th, 14th, 15th, 16th) seem to
have been excised through mere wantonness,—the veriest
licentiousness.—In the meantime, so far are Drs. Westcott
and Hort from accepting the foregoing account of the matter,
that they even style the 1st <span class="tei tei-q">“a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">perverse interpolation</span></em>:”</span> in
which view of the subject, however, they enjoy the distinction
of standing entirely alone. With the same <span class="tei tei-q">“moral certainty,”</span>
they further proceed to shut up within double
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page077">[pg 077]</span><a name="Pg077" id="Pg077" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
brackets the 2nd, 4th, 7th, 10th, 11th, 12th, 14th, 15th:
while the 3rd, 5th, 6th, 13th, and 16th, they exclude from
their Text as indisputably spurious matter.

Now, we are not about to abuse our Readers' patience by
an investigation of the several points raised by the foregoing
statement. In fact, all should have been passed by in silence,
but that unhappily the <span class="tei tei-q">“Revision”</span> of our Authorized Version
is touched thereby very nearly indeed. So intimate
(may we not say, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">so fatal</span></em>?) proves to be the sympathy
between the labours of Drs. Westcott and Hort and those of
our Revisionists, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">that whatever the former have shut up within

only allies discoverable for <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">d</span></span> are a few copies of the old
Latin. What we are saying will seem scarcely credible: but
it is a plain fact, of which any one may convince himself who
will be at the pains to inspect the critical apparatus at the
foot of the pages of Tischendorf's last (8th) edition. Our
Revisionists' notion, therefore, of what constitutes <span class="tei tei-q">“weighty
evidence”</span> is now before the Reader. If, in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">his</span></em> judgment, the
testimony of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">one single manuscript</span></em>, (and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">that</span></em> manuscript the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page078">[pg 078]</span><a name="Pg078" id="Pg078" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Codex Bezæ (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">d</span></span>),)—does really invalidate that of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">all other
Manuscripts and all other Versions</span></em> in the world,—then of
course, the Greek Text of the Revisionists will in his judgment
be a thing to be rejoiced over. But what if he should
be of opinion that such testimony, in and by itself, is simply
worthless? We shrewdly suspect that the Revisionists' view
of what constitutes <span class="tei tei-q">“weighty Evidence”</span> will be found to end
where it began, viz. in the Jerusalem Chamber.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
For, when we reach down codex <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">d</span></span> from the shelf, we are
reminded that, within the space of the three chapters of S.
Luke's Gospel now under consideration, there are in all no
less than 354 words omitted; <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">of which</span></em>, 250 <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">are omitted by</span></em> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">d</span></span>
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">alone</span></em>. May we have it explained to us why, of those 354
words, only 25 are singled out by Drs. Westcott and Hort
for permanent excision from the sacred Text? Within the
same compass, no less than 173 words have been <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">added by</span></em>
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">d</span></span> to the commonly Received Text,—146, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">substituted</span></em>,—243,
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">transposed</span></em>. May we ask how it comes to pass that of those
562 words <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">not one</span></em> has been promoted to their margin by
the Revisionists?... Return we, however, to our list of the
changes which they actually <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">have</span></em> effected.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(1) Now, that ecclesiastical usage and the parallel places
would seriously affect such precious words as are found in S.
Luke xxii. 19, 20,—was to have been expected. Yet has the
type been preserved all along, from the beginning, with
singular exactness; except in one little handful of singularly
licentious documents, viz. in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">d</span></span> a ff<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">2</span></span> i l, which <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">leave all out</span></em>;—in
b e, which substitute verses 17 and 18;—and in <span class="tei tei-q">“the
singular and sometimes rather wild Curetonian Syriac Version,”</span><a id="noteref_191" name="noteref_191" href="#note_191"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">191</span></span></a>
which, retaining the 10 words of ver. 19, substitutes
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page079">[pg 079]</span><a name="Pg079" id="Pg079" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
verses 17, 18 for ver. 20. Enough for the condemnation of
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">d</span></span> survives in Justin,<a id="noteref_192" name="noteref_192" href="#note_192"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">192</span></span></a>—Basil,<a id="noteref_193" name="noteref_193" href="#note_193"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">193</span></span></a>—Epiphanius,<a id="noteref_194" name="noteref_194" href="#note_194"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">194</span></span></a>—Theodoret,<a id="noteref_195" name="noteref_195" href="#note_195"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">195</span></span></a>—Cyril,<a id="noteref_196" name="noteref_196" href="#note_196"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">196</span></span></a>—Maximus,<a id="noteref_197" name="noteref_197" href="#note_197"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">197</span></span></a>—Jerome.<a id="noteref_198" name="noteref_198" href="#note_198"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">198</span></span></a>
But why delay ourselves concerning
a place vouched for <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">by every known copy of the Gospels
except</span></em> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">d</span></span>? Drs. Westcott and Hort entertain <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">no moral
doubt</span></em> that the [32] words [given at foot<a id="noteref_199" name="noteref_199" href="#note_199"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">199</span></span></a>] were absent from
the original text of S. Luke;”</span> in which opinion, happily,
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">they stand alone</span></em>. But why did our Revisionists suffer themselves
to be led astray by such blind guidance?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The next place is entitled to far graver attention, and may
on no account be lightly dismissed, seeing that these two
verses contain the sole record of that <span class="tei tei-q">“Agony in the Garden”</span>
which the universal Church has almost erected into an
article of the Faith.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(2) That the incident of the ministering Angel, the Agony
and bloody sweat of the world's Redeemer (S. Luke xxii. 43,
44), was anciently absent from certain copies of the Gospels,
is expressly recorded by Hilary,<a id="noteref_200" name="noteref_200" href="#note_200"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">200</span></span></a> by Jerome,<a id="noteref_201" name="noteref_201" href="#note_201"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">201</span></span></a> and others.
Only necessary is it to read the apologetic remarks which
Ambrose introduces when he reaches S. Luke xxii. 43,<a id="noteref_202" name="noteref_202" href="#note_202"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">202</span></span></a> to
understand what has evidently led to this serious mutilation
of Scripture,—traces of which survive at this day exclusively
in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">four</span></em> codices, viz. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a b r t</span></span>. Singular to relate, in the
Gospel which was read on Maundy-Thursday these two
verses of S. Luke's Gospel are thrust in between the 39th
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page080">[pg 080]</span><a name="Pg080" id="Pg080" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and the 40th verses of S. Matthew xxvi. Hence, 4 cursive
copies, viz. 13-69-124-346—(confessedly derived from a
common ancient archetype,<a id="noteref_203" name="noteref_203" href="#note_203"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">203</span></span></a> and therefore not four witnesses
but only one),—actually exhibit these two Verses
in that place. But will any unprejudiced person of sound
mind entertain a doubt concerning the genuineness of these
two verses, witnessed to as they are by <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the whole body of the
Manuscripts</span></em>, uncial as well as cursive, and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">by every ancient

that the following enumeration of ancient Fathers, who

It will be seen that we have been enumerating <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">upwards of
forty famous personages from every part of ancient Christendom</span></em>,
who recognize these verses as genuine; fourteen of them
being as old,—some of them, a great deal older,—than our
oldest MSS.—<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Why</span></em> therefore Drs. Westcott and Hort should
insist on shutting up these 26 precious words—this article
of the Faith—in double brackets, in token that it is <span class="tei tei-q">“morally
certain”</span> that verses 43 and 44 are of spurious origin, we are
at a loss to divine.<a id="noteref_240" name="noteref_240" href="#note_240"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">240</span></span></a> We can but ejaculate (in the very
words they proceed to disallow),—<span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Father</span></span>, forgive them; for
they know not what they do.”</span> But our especial concern is
with <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">our Revisionists</span></em>; and we do not exceed our province
when we come forward to reproach them sternly for having
succumbed to such evil counsels, and deliberately branded
these Verses with their own corporate expression of doubt.
For unless <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">that</span></em> be the purpose of the marginal Note which
they have set against these verses, we fail to understand the
Revisers' language and are wholly at a loss to divine what
purpose that note of theirs can be meant to serve. It is prefaced
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page082">[pg 082]</span><a name="Pg082" id="Pg082" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
by a formula which, (as we learn from their own
Preface,) offers to the reader the <span class="tei tei-q">“alternative”</span> of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">omitting</span></em> the
Verses in question: implies that <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">it would not be safe</span></em>”</span> any
longer to accept them,—as the Church has hitherto done,—with
undoubting confidence. In a word,—<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">it brands them with
suspicion</span></em>.... We have been so full on this subject,—(not
half of our references were known to Tischendorf,)—because
of the unspeakable preciousness of the record; and because
we desire to see an end at last to expressions of doubt and
uncertainty on points which really afford not a shadow of
pretence for either. These two Verses were excised through
mistaken piety by certain of the orthodox,—jealous for the
honour of their <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span></span>, and alarmed by the use which the
impugners of His <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">God</span></span>head freely made of them.<a id="noteref_241" name="noteref_241" href="#note_241"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">241</span></span></a> Hence
Ephraem [<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Carmina Nisibena</span></span>, p. 145] puts the following words
into the mouth of Satan, addressing the host of Hell:—<span class="tei tei-q">“One
thing I witnessed in Him which especially comforts me. I
saw Him praying; and I rejoiced, for His countenance
changed and He was afraid. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">His sweat was drops of blood</span></em>,
for He had a presentiment that His day had come. This was
the fairest sight of all,—unless, to be sure, He was practising
deception on me. For verily if He hath deceived me, then it
is all over,—both with me, and with you, my servants!”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(4) Next in importance after the preceding, comes the
Prayer which the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Saviour</span></span> of the World breathed from the
Cross on behalf of His murderers (S. Luke xxiii. 34). These
twelve precious words,—(<span class="tei tei-q">“Then said <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Jesus, Father</span></span>, forgive
them; for they know not what they do,”</span>)—like those
twenty-six words in S. Luke xxii. 43, 44 which we have been
considering already, Drs. Westcott and Hort enclose within
double brackets in token of the <span class="tei tei-q">“moral certainty”</span> they entertain
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page083">[pg 083]</span><a name="Pg083" id="Pg083" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">what</span></em>,—(we ask the question with sincere simplicity,)—<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">what</span></em>
amount of evidence is calculated to inspire undoubting
confidence in any existing Reading, if not such a concurrence
of Authorities as this?... We forbear to insist upon the probabilities
of the case. The Divine power and sweetness of the
incident shall not be enlarged upon. We introduce no
considerations resulting from Internal Evidence. True, that
<span class="tei tei-q">“few verses of the Gospels bear in themselves a surer witness
to the Truth of what they record, than this.”</span> (It is the
admission of the very man<a id="noteref_243" name="noteref_243" href="#note_243"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">243</span></span></a> who has nevertheless dared to
brand it with suspicion.) But we reject his loathsome patronage
with indignation. <span class="tei tei-q">“Internal Evidence,”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“Transcriptional
Probability,”</span>—and all such <span class="tei tei-q">“chaff and draff,”</span> with which he
fills his pages <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">ad nauseam</span></span>, and mystifies nobody but himself,—shall
be allowed no place in the present discussion. Let
this verse of Scripture stand or fall as it meets with sufficient
external testimony, or is forsaken thereby. How then about
the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Patristic</span></em> evidence,—for this is all that remains unexplored?

We have thus again enumerated <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">upwards of forty</span></em> ancient

the text of which (according to Bp. Ellicott<a id="noteref_283" name="noteref_283" href="#note_283"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">283</span></span></a>) <span class="tei tei-q">“is of a

For no other reason but because א <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b c l</span></span>, with some Latin

The Reader is therefore invited to notice that the tables have

century omitted the words, because they were in his way.
Calamitous however it is that a clause which the Church has
long since deliberately reinstated should, in the year 1881, be
as deliberately banished for the second time from the sacred
page by our Revisionists; who under the plea of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">amending
our English Authorized Version</span></em> have (with the best intentions)
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">falsified the Greek Text</span></em> of the Gospels in countless

although Manuscripts, Versions, Fathers from the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">second

in its favour.

V. In conclusion, we propose to advert, just for a moment,
to those five several mis-representations of S. Luke's <span class="tei tei-q">“Title
on the Cross,”</span> which were rehearsed above, viz. in page <a href="#Pg086" class="tei tei-ref">86</a>.
At so gross an exhibition of licentiousness, it is the mere
instinct of Natural Piety to exclaim,—But then, could not
those men even set down so sacred a record as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">that</span></em>, correctly?
They could, had they been so minded, no doubt, (we answer):
but, marvellous to relate, the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Transposition</span></span> of words,—no
matter how significant, sacred, solemn;—of short clauses,—even
of whole sentences of Scripture;—was anciently
accounted an allowable, even a graceful exercise of the critical
faculty.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The thing alluded to is incredible at first sight; being so
often done, apparently, without any reason whatever,—or
rather in defiance of all reason. Let <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">candidus lector</span></span> be the
judge whether we speak truly or not. Whereas S. Luke
(xxiv. 41) says, <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">And while they yet believed not for joy,
and wondered</span></span>,”</span> the scribe of codex <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a</span></span> (by way of improving
upon the Evangelist) transposes his sentence into this, <span class="tei tei-q">“And
while they yet disbelieved Him, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">and wondered for joy</span></em>:”</span><a id="noteref_342" name="noteref_342" href="#note_342"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">342</span></span></a>
which is almost nonsense, or quite.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But take a less solemn example. Instead of,—<span class="tei tei-q">“And His
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page094">[pg 094]</span><a name="Pg094" id="Pg094" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

(καὶ ἤσθιον τοὺς στάχυας,) rubbing them,”</span> &amp;c. Now this
might have been an agreeable occupation for horses and for
another quadruped, no doubt; but hardly for men. This
curiosity, which (happily) proved indigestible to our Revisionists,
is nevertheless swallowed whole by Drs. Westcott
and Hort as genuine and wholesome Gospel. (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">O dura

Then further, these preposterous Transpositions are of
such perpetual recurrence,—are so utterly useless or else so

astonishment. What <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">does</span></em> astonish us, however, is to find
learned men in the year of grace 1881, freely resuscitating
these long-since-forgotten <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">bêtises</span></span> of long-since-forgotten
Critics, and seeking to palm them off upon a busy and a

Every other case of Transposition they have rejected. By
their own confession, therefore, 49 out of the 74 (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> two-thirds
of the entire number) are instances of depravation.
We turn with curiosity to the Revised Version; and discover
that out of the 25 so retained, the Editors in question were
only able to persuade the Revisionists to adopt 8. So that,
in the judgment of the Revisionists, 66 out of 74, or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">eleven-twelfths</span></em>,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page096">[pg 096]</span><a name="Pg096" id="Pg096" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
are instances of licentious tampering with the
deposit.... O to participate in the verifying faculty which
guided the teachers to discern in 25 cases of Transposition
out of 74, the genuine work of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Holy Ghost</span></span>! O, far
more, to have been born with that loftier instinct which
enabled the pupils (Doctors Roberts and Milligan, Newth
and Moulton, Vance Smith and Brown, Angus and Eadie) to
winnow out from the entire lot exactly 8, and to reject the
remaining 66 as nothing worth!
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
According to our own best judgment, (and we have carefully
examined them all,) <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">every one</span></em> of the 74 is worthless.
But then <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">we</span></em> make it our fundamental rule to reason always
from grounds of external Evidence,—never from postulates of
the Imagination. Moreover, in the application of our rule,
we begrudge no amount of labour: reckoning a long summer's
day well spent if it has enabled us to ascertain the truth
concerning one single controverted word of Scripture. Thus,
when we find that our Revisionists, at the suggestion of
Dr. Hort, have transposed the familiar Angelic utterance (in
S. Luke xxiv. 7), λέγων ὅτι δεῖ τὸν υἱὸν τοῦ ἀνθρώπου παραδοθῆναι,—into
this, λέγων τὸν υἱὸν τοῦ ἀνθρώπου ὅτι δεῖ, &amp;c.,
we at once enquire for <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the evidence</span></em>. And when we find that
no single Father, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">no</span></em> single Version, and no Codex—except
the notorious א <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b c l</span></span>—advocates the proposed transposition;
but on the contrary that every Father (from <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 150 downwards)
who quotes the place, quotes it as it stands in the
Textus receptus;<a id="noteref_345" name="noteref_345" href="#note_345"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">345</span></span></a>—we have no hesitation whatever in
rejecting it. It is found in the midst of a very thicket of
fabricated readings. It has nothing whatever to recommend
it. It is condemned by the consentient voice of Antiquity.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page097">[pg 097]</span><a name="Pg097" id="Pg097" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
It is advocated only by four copies,—which <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">never</span></em> combine
exclusively, except to misrepresent the truth of Scripture
and to seduce the simple.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But the foregoing, which is a fair typical sample of countless
other instances of unauthorized Transposition, may not
be dismissed without a few words of serious remonstrance.
Our contention is that, inasmuch as the effect of such transposition
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">is incapable of being idiomatically represented in the English
language</span></em>,—(for, in all such cases, the Revised Version
retains the rendering of the Authorized,)—our Revisionists
have violated the spirit as well as the letter of their instructions,
in putting forth <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">a new Greek Text</span></em>, and silently introducing
into it a countless number of these and similar
depravations of Scripture. These Textual curiosities (for
they are nothing more) are absolutely out of place in a
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Revision of the English Version</span></span>: achieve no lawful purpose:
are sure to mislead the unwary. This first.—Secondly, we
submit that,—strong as, no doubt, the temptation must have
been, to secure the sanction of the N. T. Revisionists for their
own private Recension of the Greek, (printed long since, but
published simultaneously with the <span class="tei tei-q">“Revised Version”</span>)—it is
to be regretted that Drs. Westcott and Hort should have
yielded thereto. Man's impatience never promotes <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">God's</span></span>
Truth. The interests of Textual Criticism would rather have
suggested, that the Recension of that accomplished pair of
Professors should have been submitted to public inspection
in the first instance. The astonishing Text which it advocates
might have been left with comparative safety to take its
chance in the Jerusalem Chamber, after it had undergone
the searching ordeal of competent Criticism, and been freely
ventilated at home and abroad for a decade of years. But
on the contrary. It was kept close. It might be seen only
by the Revisers: and even <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">they</span></em> were tied down to secrecy as
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page098">[pg 098]</span><a name="Pg098" id="Pg098" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
to the letter-press by which it was accompanied.... All
this strikes us as painful in a high degree.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The place of Scripture before us, the Reader is assured,
presents a memorable instance of the mischief which occasionally
resulted to the inspired Text from the ancient
practice of executing copies of the Scriptures in uncial
characters. S. Paul <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">certainly</span></em> wrote μέγα ἐστὶ τὸ τῆς εὐσεβείας
μυστήριον; Θεὸς ἐφανερώθη ἐν σαρκί, (<span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Great is the
mystery of godliness</span></span>: <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">God</span></span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">was manifested in the flesh</span></span>”</span>) But
it requires to be explained at the outset, that the holy Name
when abbreviated (which it always was), thus,—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="text-decoration: underline">ΘΣ</span></span> (<span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">God</span></span>”</span>),
is only distinguishable from the relative pronoun <span class="tei tei-q">“who”</span> (ΟΣ),
by two horizontal strokes,—which, in manuscripts of early
date, it was often the practice to trace so faintly that at
present they can scarcely be discerned.<a id="noteref_348" name="noteref_348" href="#note_348"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">348</span></span></a> Need we go on?
An archetypal copy in which one or both of these slight
strokes had vanished from the word <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="text-decoration: underline">ΘΣ</span></span> (<span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">God</span></span>”</span>), gave rise
to the reading ΟΣ (<span class="tei tei-q">“who”</span>),—of which nonsensical substitute,
traces survive in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">only two</span></em><a id="noteref_349" name="noteref_349" href="#note_349"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">349</span></span></a> manuscripts,—א and 17: not, for
certain, in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">one single</span></em> ancient Father,—no, nor for certain in
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">one single</span></em> ancient Version. So transparent, in fact, is the
absurdity of writing τὸ μυστέριον ὅς (<span class="tei tei-q">“the mystery <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">who</span></em>”</span>),
that copyists promptly substituted ὅ (<span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">which</span></em>”</span>): thus furnishing
another illustration of the well-known property of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page100">[pg 100]</span><a name="Pg100" id="Pg100" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
a fabricated reading, viz. sooner or later inevitably to become
the parent of a second. Happily, to this second mistake
the sole surviving witness is the Codex Claromontanus, of
the VIth century (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">d</span></span>): the only Patristic evidence in its
favour being Gelasius of Cyzicus,<a id="noteref_350" name="noteref_350" href="#note_350"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">350</span></span></a> (whose date is <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 476):
and the unknown author of a homily in the appendix to
Chrysostom.<a id="noteref_351" name="noteref_351" href="#note_351"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">351</span></span></a> The Versions—all but the Georgian and the
Slavonic, which agree with the Received Text—favour it
unquestionably; for they are observed invariably to make
the relative pronoun agree in gender with the word which
represents μυστήριον (<span class="tei tei-q">“mystery”</span>) which immediately precedes
it. Thus, in the Syriac Versions, ὅς (<span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">who</span></em>”</span>) is found,—but
only because the Syriac equivalent for μυστήριον is
of the masculine gender: in the Latin, <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">quod</span></span> (<span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">which</span></em>”</span>)—but
only because <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">mysterium</span></span> in Latin (like μυστήριον in Greek)
is neuter. Over this latter reading, however, we need not
linger; seeing that ὅ does not find a single patron at the
present day. And yet, this was the reading which was eagerly
upheld during the last century: Wetstein and Sir Isaac
Newton being its most strenuous advocates.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is time to pass under hasty review the direct evidence
for the true reading. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a</span></span> and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">c</span></span> exhibited <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="text-decoration: underline">ΘΣ</span></span> until
ink, thumbing, and the injurious use of chemicals, obliterated
what once was patent. It is too late, by full 150 years, to
contend on the negative side of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">this</span></em> question.—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">f</span></span> and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">g</span></span>,
which exhibit <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="text-decoration: underline">ΟΣ</span></span> and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="text-decoration: underline">ΟΣ</span></span> respectively, were confessedly
derived from a common archetype: in which archetype, it is
evident that the horizontal stroke which distinguishes Θ
from Ο must have been so faintly traced as to be scarcely
discernible. The supposition that, in this place, the stroke
in question represents <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the aspirate</span></em>, is scarcely admissible.
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">There is no single example of</span></em> ὅς <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">written</span></em> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="text-decoration: underline">ΟΣ</span></span> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in any part of

where ΟΣ represents <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="text-decoration: underline">ΘΣ</span></span>, it is written <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="text-decoration: underline">ΟΣ</span></span> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in both</span></em>. Prejudice
herself may be safely called upon to accept the obvious

The universal consent of the Lectionaries proves that Θεός
has been read in all the assemblies of the faithful from the
IVth or Vth century of our era. At what earlier period of
her existence is it supposed then that the Church (<span class="tei tei-q">“the
witness and keeper of Holy Writ,”</span>) availed herself of her
privilege to substitute Θεός for ὅς or ὅ,—whether in error

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Against this array of Testimony, the only evidence which the
unwearied industry of 150 years has succeeded in eliciting,
is as follows:—(1) The exploded <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Latin</span></em> fable that Macedonius
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 506) <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">invented</span></em> the reading:<a id="noteref_371" name="noteref_371" href="#note_371"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">371</span></span></a>—(2) the fact that
Epiphanius,—<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">professing to transcribe</span></em><a id="noteref_372" name="noteref_372" href="#note_372"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">372</span></span></a> from an earlier treatise
of his own<a id="noteref_373" name="noteref_373" href="#note_373"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">373</span></span></a> (in which ἐφανερώθη stands <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">without a nominative</span></em>),
prefixes ὅς:—(3) the statement of an unknown
scholiast, that in one particular place of Cyril's writings
where the Greek is lost, Cyril wrote ὅς,—(which seems to
be an entire mistake; but which, even if it were a fact, would
be sufficiently explained by the discovery that in two other
places of Cyril's writings the evidence <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">fluctuates</span></em> between ὅς
and Θεός):—(4) a quotation in an epistle of Eutherius of
Tyana (it exists only in Latin) where <span class="tei tei-q">“qui”</span> is found:—(5)
a casual reference (in Jerome's commentary on Isaiah) to
our <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span></span>, as One <span class="tei tei-q">“qui apparuit in carne, justificatus est in
spiritu,”</span>—which Bp. Pearson might have written.—Lastly, (6)
a passage of Theodorus Mopsuest. (quoted at the Council
of Constantinople, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 553), where the reading is <span class="tei tei-q">“qui,”</span>—which
is balanced by the discovery that in another place
of his writings quoted at the same Council, the original is
translated <span class="tei tei-q">“quod.”</span> And this closes the evidence. Will any
unprejudiced person, on reviewing the premisses, seriously
declare that ὅς is the better sustained reading of the two?

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
For ourselves, we venture to deem it incredible that a
Reading which—(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">a</span></span>) Is not to be found in more than two
copies (א and 17) of S. Paul's Epistles: which—(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">b</span></span>) Is not
certainly supported by a single Version:—(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">c</span></span>) Nor is clearly
advocated by a single Father,—<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">can</span></em> be genuine. It does not at
all events admit of question, that until <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">far</span></em> stronger evidence
can be produced in its favour, ὅς (<span class="tei tei-q">“who”</span>) may on no account
be permitted to usurp the place of the commonly received
Θεός (<span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">God</span></span>”</span>) of 1 Tim. iii. 16. But the present exhibits in a
striking and instructive way all the characteristic tokens of
a depravation of the text. (1st) At an exceedingly early
period it resulted in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">another</span></em> deflection. (2nd) It is without
the note of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Continuity</span></em>; having died out of the Church's
memory well-nigh 1400 years ago. (3rd) It is deficient in
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Universality</span></em>; having been all along denied the Church's corporate
sanction. As a necessary consequence, (4th) It rests
at this day on wholly <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">insufficient Evidence</span></em>: Manuscripts,
Versions, Fathers being <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">all</span></em> against it. (5th) It carries on
its front its own refutation. For, as all must see, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="text-decoration: underline">ΘΣ</span></span> might
easily be mistaken for ΟΣ: but in order to make ΟΣ into
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="text-decoration: underline">ΘΣ</span></span>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">two horizontal lines must of set purpose be added to the
copy</span></em>. It is therefore a vast deal <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">more likely</span></em> that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="text-decoration: underline">ΘΣ</span></span> became
ΟΣ, than that ΟΣ became <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="text-decoration: underline">ΘΣ</span></span>. (6th) Lastly, it is condemned
by internal considerations. Ὅς is in truth so grossly improbable—rather,
so <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">impossible</span></em>—a reading, that under any
circumstances we must have anxiously enquired whether no
escape from it was discoverable: whether there exists no
way of explaining <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">how</span></em> so patent an absurdity as μυστέριον
ὅς <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">may</span></em> have arisen? And on being reminded that the
disappearance of two faint horizontal strokes, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">or even of one</span></em>,
would fully account for the impossible reading,—(and thus
much, at least, all admit,)—should we not have felt that it
required an overwhelming consensus of authorities in favour
of ὅς, to render such an alternative deserving of serious
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page105">[pg 105]</span><a name="Pg105" id="Pg105" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
attention? It is a mere abuse of Bengel's famous axiom
to recal it on occasions like the present. We shall be landed
in a bathos indeed if we allow <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">gross improbability</span></em> to become a
constraining motive with us in revising the sacred Text.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And thus much for the true reading of 1 Tim. iii. 16. We
invite the reader to refer back<a id="noteref_374" name="noteref_374" href="#note_374"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">374</span></span></a> to a Reviser's estimate of
the evidence in favour of Θεός and ὅς respectively, and to
contrast it with our own. If he is impressed with the
strength of the cause of our opponents,—their mastery of the
subject,—and the reasonableness of their contention,—we
shall be surprised. And yet <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">that</span></em> is not the question just
now before us. The <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">only</span></em> question (be it clearly remembered)
which has to be considered, is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">this</span></em>:—Can it be said
with truth that the <span class="tei tei-q">“evidence”</span> for ὅς (as against Θεός)
in 1 Tim. iii. 16 is <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">clearly preponderating</span></em>”</span>? Can it be
maintained that Θεός is a <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">plain and clear error</span></em>”</span>? Unless
this can be affirmed—<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">cadit quæstio</span></span>. The traditional reading
of the place ought to have been let alone. May we be
permitted to say without offence that, in our humble judgment,
if the Church of England, at the Revisers' bidding,
were to adopt this and thousands of other depravations of
the sacred page,<a id="noteref_375" name="noteref_375" href="#note_375"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">375</span></span></a>—with which the Church Universal was once
well acquainted, but which in her corporate character she has
long since unconditionally condemned and abandoned,—she
would deserve to be pointed at with scorn by the rest of
Christendom? Yes, and to have <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">that</span></em> openly said of her
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page106">[pg 106]</span><a name="Pg106" id="Pg106" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
which S. Peter openly said of the false teachers of his day
who fell back into the very errors which they had already
abjured. The place will be found in 2 S. Peter ii. 22. So singularly
applicable is it to the matter in hand, that we can but
invite attention to the quotation on our title-page and p. 1.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And here we make an end.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
1. Those who may have taken up the present Article in
expectation of being entertained with another of those discussions
(of which we suspect the public must be already
getting somewhat weary), concerning the degree of ability
which the New Testament Revisionists have displayed in
their rendering into English of the Greek, will at first experience
disappointment. Readers of intelligence, however, who
have been at the pains to follow us through the foregoing
pages, will be constrained to admit that we have done more
faithful service to the cause of Sacred Truth by the course
we have been pursuing, than if we had merely multiplied
instances of incorrect and unsatisfactory <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Translation</span></em>. There
is (and this we endeavoured to explain at the outset) a question
of prior interest and far graver importance which has to
be settled <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">first</span></em>, viz. the degree of confidence which is due to
the underlying <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">new Greek text</span></span> which our Revisionists have
constructed. In other words, before discussing their <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">new
Renderings</span></em>, we have to examine their <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">new Readings</span></em>.<a id="noteref_376" name="noteref_376" href="#note_376"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">376</span></span></a> The
silence which Scholars have hitherto maintained on this part
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page107">[pg 107]</span><a name="Pg107" id="Pg107" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of the subject is to ourselves scarcely intelligible. But it makes
us the more anxious to invite attention to this neglected aspect
of the problem; the rather, because we have thoroughly convinced
ourselves that the <span class="tei tei-q">“new Greek Text”</span> put forth by the
Revisionists of our Authorized Version is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">utterly inadmissible</span></em>.
The traditional Text has been departed from by them
nearly 6000 times,—almost invariably <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">for the worse</span></em>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
2. Fully to dispose of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">all</span></em> these multitudinous corruptions
would require a bulky Treatise. But the reader is requested
to observe that, if we are right in the few instances we
have culled out from the mass,—<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">then we are right in all</span></em>. If
we have succeeded in proving that the little handful of
authorities on which the <span class="tei tei-q">“new Greek Text”</span> depends, are the
reverse of trustworthy,—are absolutely misleading,—then,
we have cut away from under the Revisionists the very
ground on which they have hitherto been standing. And in
that case, the structure which they have built up throughout
a decade of years, with such evident self-complacency, collapses
<span class="tei tei-q">“like the baseless fabric of a vision.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
3. For no one may flatter himself that, by undergoing
a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">further</span></em> process of <span class="tei tei-q">“Revision,”</span> the <span class="tei tei-q">“Revised Version”</span> may
after all be rendered trustworthy. The eloquent and excellent
Bishop of Derry is <span class="tei tei-q">“convinced that, with all its undeniable
merits, it will have to be somewhat extensively revised.”</span>
And so perhaps are we. But (what is a far more important
circumstance) we are further convinced that a prior act of
penance to be submitted to by the Revisers would be the
restoration of the underlying Greek Text to very nearly—<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">not
quite</span></em>—the state in which they found it when they entered
upon their ill-advised undertaking. <span class="tei tei-q">“Very nearly—not
quite:”</span> for, in not a few particulars, the <span class="tei tei-q">“Textus receptus”</span>
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">does</span></em> call for Revision, certainly; although Revision on
entirely different principles from those which are found to
have prevailed in the Jerusalem Chamber. To mention a
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page108">[pg 108]</span><a name="Pg108" id="Pg108" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
single instance:—When our <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span></span> first sent forth His Twelve
Apostles, it was certainly no part of His ministerial commission
to them to <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">raise the dead</span></em>”</span> (νεκροὺς ἐγείρετε, S.
Matthew x. 8). This is easily demonstrable. Yet is the
spurious clause retained by our Revisionists; because it is
found in those corrupt witnesses—א <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b c d</span></span>, and the Latin
copies.<a id="noteref_377" name="noteref_377" href="#note_377"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">377</span></span></a> When will men learn unconditionally to put away
from themselves the weak superstition which is for investing
with oracular authority the foregoing quaternion of demonstrably
depraved Codices?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
4. <span class="tei tei-q">“It may be said”</span>—(to quote again from Bp. Alexander's
recent Charge),—<span class="tei tei-q">“that there is a want of modesty in dissenting
from the conclusions of a two-thirds majority of a body
so learned. But the rough process of counting heads imposes
unduly on the imagination. One could easily name <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">eight</span></em>
in that assembly, whose <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">unanimity</span></em> would be practically
almost decisive; but we have no means of knowing that
these did not <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">form the minority</span></em> in resisting the changes
which we most regret.”</span> The Bishop is speaking of the
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">English</span></em> Revision. Having regard to the Greek Text exclusively,
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">we</span></em> also (strange to relate) had singled out <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">exactly eight</span></em>
from the members of the New Testament company—Divines
of undoubted orthodoxy, who for their splendid scholarship
and proficiency in the best learning, or else for their refined
taste and admirable judgment, might (as we humbly think),
under certain safeguards, have been safely entrusted even with
the responsibility of revising the Sacred Text. Under the
guidance of Prebendary Scrivener (who among living Englishmen
is <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">facile princeps</span></span> in these pursuits) it is scarcely to be
anticipated that, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">when unanimous</span></span>, such Divines would ever
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page109">[pg 109]</span><a name="Pg109" id="Pg109" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
have materially erred. But then, of course, a previous life-long
familiarity with the Science of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Textual Criticism</span></em>, or at
least leisure for prosecuting it now, for ten or twenty years,
with absolutely undivided attention,—would be the indispensable
requisite for the success of such an undertaking; and
this, undeniably, is a qualification rather to be desiderated
than looked for at the hands of English Divines of note at
the present day. On the other hand, (loyalty to our Master
constrains us to make the avowal,) the motley assortment of
names, twenty-eight in all, specified by Dr. Newth, at p. 125
of his interesting little volume, joined to the fact that the
average attendance <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">was not so many as sixteen</span></em>,—concerning
whom, moreover, the fact has transpired that some of the
most judicious of their number often <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">declined to give any
vote at all</span></em>,—is by no means calculated to inspire any sort of
confidence. But, in truth, considerable familiarity with these
pursuits may easily co-exist with a natural inaptitude for
their successful cultivation, which shall prove simply fatal.
In support of this remark, one has but to refer to the
instance supplied by Dr. Hort. The Sacred Text has none
to fear so much as those who <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">feel</span></em> rather than think: who
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">imagine</span></em> rather than reason: who rely on a supposed <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">verifying
faculty</span></em> of their own, of which they are able to render
no intelligible account; and who, (to use Bishop Ellicott's
phrase,) have the misfortune to conceive themselves possessed
of a <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">power of divining the Original Text</span></em>,”</span>—which would
be even diverting, if the practical result of their self-deception
were not so exceedingly serious.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
5. In a future number, we may perhaps enquire into the
measure of success which has attended the Revisers' <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Revision
of the English</span></em> of our Authorized Version of 1611. We have
occupied ourselves at this time exclusively with a survey
of the seriously mutilated and otherwise grossly depraved
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">new Greek text</span></span>, on which their edifice has been reared.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page110">[pg 110]</span><a name="Pg110" id="Pg110" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
And the circumstance which, in conclusion, we desire to
impress upon our Readers, is this,—that the insecurity
of that foundation is so alarming, that, except as a concession
due to the solemnity of the undertaking just now
under review, further Criticism might very well be dispensed
with, as a thing superfluous. Even could it be proved
concerning the superstructure, that <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">it had been [ever so] well
builded</span></em>,”</span><a id="noteref_378" name="noteref_378" href="#note_378"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">378</span></span></a> (to adopt another of our Revisionists' unhappy perversions
of Scripture,) the fatal objection would remain, viz.
that it is not <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">founded upon the rock</span></em>.”</span><a id="noteref_379" name="noteref_379" href="#note_379"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">379</span></span></a> It has been the ruin
of the present undertaking—as far as the Sacred Text is concerned—that
the majority of the Revisionist body have been
misled throughout by the oracular decrees and impetuous
advocacy of Drs. Westcott and Hort; who, with the purest
intentions and most laudable industry, have constructed a
Text demonstrably more remote from the Evangelic verity,
than any which has ever yet seen the light. <span class="tei tei-q">“The old is
good,”</span><a id="noteref_380" name="noteref_380" href="#note_380"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">380</span></span></a> say the Revisionists: but we venture solemnly to
assure them that <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the old is better</span></em>;”</span><a id="noteref_381" name="noteref_381" href="#note_381"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">381</span></span></a> and that this remark
holds every bit as true of their Revision of the Greek
throughout, as of their infelicitous exhibition of S. Luke v. 39.
To attempt, as they have done, to build the Text of the New
Testament on a tissue of unproved assertions and the eccentricities
of a single codex of bad character, is about as hopeful
a proceeding as would be the attempt to erect an Eddystone
lighthouse on the Goodwin Sands.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Whatever may be urged in favour of Biblical Revision, it
is at least undeniable that the undertaking involves a tremendous
risk. Our Authorized Version is the one religious
link which at present binds together ninety millions of
English-speaking men scattered over the earth's surface. Is
it reasonable that so unutterably precious, so sacred a bond
should be endangered, for the sake of representing certain
words more accurately,—here and there translating a tense
with greater precision,—getting rid of a few archaisms? It
may be confidently assumed that no <span class="tei tei-q">“Revision”</span> of our
Authorized Version, however judiciously executed, will ever
occupy the place in public esteem which is actually enjoyed
by the work of the Translators of 1611,—the noblest literary
work in the Anglo-Saxon language. We shall in fact never
have <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">another</span></em> <span class="tei tei-q">“Authorized Version.”</span> And this single consideration
may be thought absolutely fatal to the project,
except in a greatly modified form. To be brief,—As a
companion in the study and for private edification: as a
book of reference for critical purposes, especially in respect
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page114">[pg 114]</span><a name="Pg114" id="Pg114" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of difficult and controverted passages:—we hold that a
revised edition of the Authorized Version of our English
Bible, (if executed with consummate ability and learning,)
would at any time be a work of inestimable value. The
method of such a performance, whether by marginal Notes
or in some other way, we forbear to determine. But
certainly only as a handmaid is it to be desired. As something
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">intended to supersede</span></em> our present English Bible, we are
thoroughly convinced that the project of a rival Translation
is not to be entertained for a moment. For ourselves, we
deprecate it entirely.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
On the other hand, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">who</span></em> could have possibly foreseen what
has actually come to pass since the Convocation of the
Southern Province (in Feb. 1870) declared itself favourable
to <span class="tei tei-q">“a Revision of the Authorized Version,”</span> and appointed a
Committee of Divines to undertake the work? <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Who</span></em> was
to suppose that the Instructions given to the Revisionists
would be by them systematically disregarded? <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Who</span></em> was
to imagine that an utterly untrustworthy <span class="tei tei-q">“new Greek Text,”</span>
constructed on mistaken principles,—(say rather, on <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">no
principles at all</span></em>,)—would be the fatal result? To speak
more truly,—<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Who</span></em> could have anticipated that the opportunity
would have been adroitly seized to inflict upon the
Church the text of Drs. Westcott and Hort, in all its
essential features,—a text which, as will be found elsewhere
largely explained, we hold to be <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the most vicious Recension of
the original Greek in existence</span></em>? Above all,—<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Who</span></em> was to
foresee that instead of removing <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">plain</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">clear errors</span></em>”</span>
from our Version, the Revisionists,—(besides systematically
removing out of sight so many of the genuine utterances of
the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Spirit</span></span>,)—would themselves introduce a countless number
of blemishes, unknown to it before? Lastly, how was it to
have been believed that the Revisionists would show themselves
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page115">[pg 115]</span><a name="Pg115" id="Pg115" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
industrious in sowing broadcast over four continents
doubts as to the Truth of Scripture, which it will never
be in their power either to remove or to recal? <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Nescit vox

</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
For, the ill-advised practice of recording, in the margin of
an English Bible, certain of the blunders—(such things
cannot by any stretch of courtesy be styled <span class="tei tei-q">“Various Readings”</span>)—which
disfigure <span class="tei tei-q">“some”</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">“many”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“ancient authorities,”</span>
can only result in hopelessly unsettling the faith of
millions. It cannot be defended on the plea of candour,—the
candour which is determined that men shall <span class="tei tei-q">“know the
worst.”</span> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span class="tei tei-q">“The worst”</span><span style="font-style: italic"> has</span></em> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">not</span></span> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">been told</span></em>: and it were dishonesty
to insinuate that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">it has</span></em>. If all the cases were faithfully
exhibited where <span class="tei tei-q">“a few,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“some,”</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">“many ancient authorities”</span>
read differently from what is exhibited in the actual
Text, not only would the margin prove insufficient to contain
the record, but <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the very page itself</span></em> would not nearly suffice.
Take a single instance (the first which comes to mind), of
the thing referred to. Such illustrations might be multiplied
to any extent:—

Now, we desire to have it explained to us <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">why</span></em> an exhibition
of the Text supported by such an amount of first-rate
primitive testimony as the preceding, obtains <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">no notice whatever</span></em>
in our Revisionists' margin,—if indeed it was the object
of their perpetually recurring marginal annotations, to put
the unlearned reader on a level with the critical Scholar;
to keep nothing back from him; and so forth?... It
is the gross one-sidedness, the patent <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">unfairness</span></em>, in a critical
point of view, of this work, (which professes to be nothing
else but <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">a Revision of the English Version of</span></em> 1611,)—which
chiefly shocks and offends us.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
For, on the other hand, of what possible use can it be
to encumber the margin of S. Luke x. 41, 42 (for example),
with the announcement that <span class="tei tei-q">“A few ancient authorities read
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Martha, Martha, thou art troubled: Mary hath chosen</span></em> &amp;c.”</span> (the
fact being, that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">d</span></span> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">alone</span></em> of MSS. omits <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">careful and ...
about many things. But one thing is needful, and</span></em>”</span> ...)?
With the record of this circumstance, is it reasonable (we
ask) to choke up our English margin,—to create perplexity
and to insinuate doubt? The author of the foregoing
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page117">[pg 117]</span><a name="Pg117" id="Pg117" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
marginal Annotation was of course aware that the same
<span class="tei tei-q">“singular codex”</span> (as Bp. Ellicott styles cod. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">d</span></span>) omits, in
S. Luke's Gospel alone, no less than 1552 words: and he will
of course have ascertained (by counting) that the words in
S. Luke's Gospel amount to 19,941. Why then did he not
tell <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the whole</span></em> truth; and instead of <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">&amp;c.</span></em>,”</span> proceed as follows?—<span class="tei tei-q">“But
inasmuch as cod. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">d</span></span> is so scandalously corrupt that
about <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">one word in thirteen</span></em> is missing throughout, the absence
of nine words in this place is of no manner of importance or
significancy. The precious saying omitted is above suspicion,
and the first half of the present Annotation might have
been spared.”</span>... We submit that a Note like that, although
rather <span class="tei tei-q">“singular”</span> in style, really <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">would</span></em> have been to some
extent helpful,—if not to the learned, at least to the unlearned
reader.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the meantime, unlearned and learned readers alike
are competent to see that the foregoing perturbation of
S. Luke x. 41, 42 rests on <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the same</span></em> manuscript authority
as the perturbation of ch. iii. 22, which immediately preceded
it. The <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Patristic</span></em> attestation, on the other hand, of the reading
which has been promoted to the margin, is almost <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">nil</span></em>:
whereas <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">that</span></em> of the neglected place has been shown to be
considerable, very ancient, and of high respectability.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But in fact,—(let the Truth be plainly stated; for, when
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">God's</span></span> Word is at stake, circumlocution is contemptible,
while concealment would be a crime;)—<span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Faithfulness</span></em>”</span>
towards the public, a stern resolve that the English reader
<span class="tei tei-q">“shall know the worst,”</span> and all that kind of thing,—such
considerations have had nothing whatever to do with the
matter. A vastly different principle has prevailed with the
Revisionists. Themselves the dupes of an utterly mistaken
Theory of Textual Criticism, their supreme solicitude has
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page118">[pg 118]</span><a name="Pg118" id="Pg118" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
been <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">to impose that same Theory</span></em>,—(<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">which is Westcott and
Hort's</span></em>,)—with all its bitter consequences, on the unlearned
and unsuspicious public.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We shall of course be indignantly called upon to explain
what we mean by so injurious—so damning—an imputation?
For all reply, we are content to refer to the sample of our
meaning which will be found below, in pp. <a href="#Pg137" class="tei tei-ref">137-8</a>. The exposure
of what has there been shown to be the method of the
Revisionists in respect of S. Mark vi. 11, might be repeated
hundreds of times. It would in fact <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">fill a volume</span></em>. We shall
therefore pass on, when we have asked the Revisionists in
turn—<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">How they have dared</span></em> so effectually to blot out those
many precious words from the Book of Life, that no mere
English reader, depending on the Revised Version for his
knowledge of the Gospels, can by possibility suspect their
existence?... Supposing even that it <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">was</span></em> the calamitous
result of their mistaken principles that they found themselves
constrained on countless occasions, to omit from their
Text precious sayings of our <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span></span> and His Apostles,—what
possible excuse will they offer for not having preserved a
record of words so amply attested, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">at least in their margin</span></em>?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Even so, however, the whole amount of the mischief which
has been effected by our Revisionists has not been stated.
For the Greek Text which they have invented proves to be
so hopelessly depraved throughout, that if it were to be
thrust upon the Church's acceptance, we should be a thousand
times worse off than we were with the Text which
Erasmus and the Complutensian,—Stephens, and Beza, and
the Elzevirs,—bequeathed to us upwards of three centuries
ago. On this part of the subject we have remarked at length
already [pp. <a href="#Pg001" class="tei tei-ref">1-110</a>]: yet shall we be constrained to recur once
and again to the underlying Greek Text of the Revisionists,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page119">[pg 119]</span><a name="Pg119" id="Pg119" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
inasmuch as it is impossible to stir in any direction with the
task before us, without being painfully reminded of its existence.
Not only do the familiar Parables, Miracles, Discourses
of our <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span></span>, trip us up at every step, but we cannot open
the first page of the Gospel—no, nor indeed read <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the first line</span></em>—without
being brought to a standstill. Thus,
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
1. S. Matthew begins,—<span class="tei tei-q">“The book of the generation of
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Jesus Christ</span></span>”</span> (ver. 1).—Good. But here the margin volunteers
two pieces of information: first,—<span class="tei tei-q">“Or, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">birth</span></em>: as in
ver. 18.”</span> We refer to ver. 18, and read—<span class="tei tei-q">“Now the birth of
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Jesus Christ</span></span> was on this wise.”</span> Good again; but the
margin says,—<span class="tei tei-q">“Or, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">generation</span></em>: as in ver. 1.”</span> Are we then
to understand that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the same Greek word</span></em>, diversely rendered
in English, occurs in both places? We refer to the <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">new</span></em>
Greek Text:”</span> and there it stands,—γένεσις in either verse.
But if the word be the same, why (on the Revisers' theory)
is it diversely rendered?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the meantime, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">who</span></em> knows not that there is all the
difference in the world between S. Matthew's γέΝΕσις, in
ver. 1,—and the same S. Matthew's γέΝΝΗσις, in ver. 18?
The latter, the Evangelist's announcement of the circumstances
of the human Nativity of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Christ</span></span>: the former, the
Evangelist's unobtrusive way of recalling the Septuagintal
rendering of Gen. ii. 4 and v. 1:<a id="noteref_393" name="noteref_393" href="#note_393"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">393</span></span></a> the same Evangelist's
calm method of guiding the devout and thoughtful student
to discern in the Gospel the History of the <span class="tei tei-q">“new Creation,”</span>—by
thus providing that when first the Gospel opens its lips, it
shall syllable the name of the first book of the elder Covenant?
We are pointing out that it more than startles—it
supremely offends—one who is even slenderly acquainted
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page120">[pg 120]</span><a name="Pg120" id="Pg120" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
with the treasures of wisdom hid in the very diction of the
N. T. Scriptures, to discover that a deliberate effort has been
made to get rid of the very foremost of those notes of Divine
intelligence, by confounding two words which all down the
ages have been carefully kept distinct; and that this effort
is the result of an exaggerated estimate of a few codices
which happen to be written in the uncial character, viz.
two of the IVth century (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b</span></span> א); one of the Vth (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">c</span></span>); two of

Versions. The Egyptian, Armenian, Æthiopic and Georgian,
have only one word for both. Let no one suppose however
that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">therefore</span></em> their testimony is ambiguous. It is γέννησις
(<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">not</span></em> γένεσις) which they exhibit, both in ver. 1 and in ver. 18.<a id="noteref_395" name="noteref_395" href="#note_395"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">395</span></span></a>
The Latin (<span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">generatio</span></span>”</span>) is an equivocal rendering certainly:
but the earliest Latin writer who quotes the two places,
(viz. Tertullian) employs the word <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">genitura</span></span>”</span> in S. Matth.
i. 1,—but <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">nativitas</span></span>”</span> in ver. 18,—which no one seems to
have noticed.<a id="noteref_396" name="noteref_396" href="#note_396"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">396</span></span></a> Now, Tertullian, (as one who sometimes
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page121">[pg 121]</span><a name="Pg121" id="Pg121" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
wrote in Greek,) is known to have been conversant with
the Greek copies of his day; and <span class="tei tei-q">“his day,”</span> be it remembered,
is <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 190. He evidently recognized the parallelism
between S. Matt. i. 1 and Gen. ii. 4,—where the old Latin
exhibits <span class="tei tei-q">“liber <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">creaturæ</span></em>”</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">facturæ</span></em>,”</span> as the rendering of
βίβλος γενέσεως. And so much for the testimony of the
Versions.

But on reference to Manuscript and to Patristic authority<a id="noteref_397" name="noteref_397" href="#note_397"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">397</span></span></a>
we are encountered by an overwhelming amount of testimony
for γέννησις in ver. 18: and this, considering the
nature of the case, is an extraordinary circumstance. Quite
plain is it that the Ancients were wide awake to the difference
between spelling the word with one N or with two,—as

circumstance, that the only Patristic authorities discoverable

2. This, however, is not all. Against the words <span class="tei tei-q">“of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Jesus
Christ</span></span>,”</span> a further critical annotation is volunteered; to the
effect that <span class="tei tei-q">“Some ancient authorities read <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">of the Christ</span></em>.”</span> In

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
3. And so much for the first, second, and third Critical
annotations, with which the margin of the revised N. T. is
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page123">[pg 123]</span><a name="Pg123" id="Pg123" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
disfigured. Hoping that the worst is now over, we read on
till we reach ver. 25, where we encounter a statement
which fairly trips us up: viz.,—<span class="tei tei-q">“And knew her not <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">till she
had brought forth a son</span></em>.”</span> No intimation is afforded of what
has been here effected; but in the meantime every one's
memory supplies the epithet (<span class="tei tei-q">“her first-born”</span>) which has
been ejected. Whether something very like indignation is
not excited by the discovery that these important words
have been surreptitiously withdrawn from their place, let
others say. For ourselves, when we find that only א <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b z</span></span>
and two cursive copies can be produced for the omission,
we are at a loss to understand of what the Revisionists can
have been dreaming. Did they know<a id="noteref_417" name="noteref_417" href="#note_417"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">417</span></span></a> that,—besides the

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page124">[pg 124]</span><a name="Pg124" id="Pg124" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
that two copies of the IVth century (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b</span></span> א) and one of the
VIth (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">z</span></span>)—all three without a character—backed by a few
copies of the old Latin, should be supposed to be any
counterpoise at all for such an array of first-rate contemporary
evidence as the foregoing?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Enough has been offered by this time to prove that an
authoritative Revision of the Greek Text will have to precede
any future Revision of the English of the New Testament.
Equally certain is it that for such an undertaking
the time has not yet come. <span class="tei tei-q">“It is my honest conviction,”</span>—(remarks
Bp. Ellicott, the Chairman of the Revisionists,)—<span class="tei tei-q">“that
for any authoritative Revision, we are not yet mature:
either in Biblical learning or Hellenistic scholarship.”</span><a id="noteref_435" name="noteref_435" href="#note_435"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">435</span></span></a>
The same opinion precisely is found to have been cherished
by Dr. Westcott till <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">within about a year-and-a-half</span></em><a id="noteref_436" name="noteref_436" href="#note_436"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">436</span></span></a> of the
first assembling of the New Testament Company in the
Jerusalem Chamber, 22nd June, 1870. True, that we enjoy
access to—suppose from 1000 to 2000—more <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">manuscripts</span></span>
than were available when the Textus Recept. was formed. But
nineteen-twentieths of those documents, for any use which
has been made of them, might just as well be still lying in
the monastic libraries from which they were obtained.—True,
that four out of our five oldest uncials have come to light
since the year 1628; but, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">who knows how to use them</span></em>?—True,
that we have made acquaintance with certain ancient
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Versions</span></span>, about which little or nothing was known 200
years ago: but,—(with the solitary exception of the Rev.
Solomon Cæsar Malan, the learned Vicar of Broadwindsor,—who,
by the way, is always ready to lend a torch to his
benighted brethren,)—what living Englishman is able to tell
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page125">[pg 125]</span><a name="Pg125" id="Pg125" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
us what they all contain? A smattering acquaintance with
the languages of ancient Egypt,—the Gothic, Æthiopic, Armenian,
Georgian and Slavonian Versions,—is of no manner
of avail. In no department, probably, is <span class="tei tei-q">“a little learning”</span>
more sure to prove <span class="tei tei-q">“a dangerous thing.”</span>—True, lastly, that
the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Fathers</span></span> have been better edited within the last 250
years: during which period some fresh Patristic writings
have also come to light. But, with the exception of Theodoret
among the Greeks and Tertullian among the Latins,
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">which of the Fathers has been satisfactorily indexed</span></em>?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Even what precedes is not nearly all. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">The fundamental
Principles</span></em> of the Science of Textual Criticism are not yet
apprehended. In proof of this assertion, we appeal to the
new Greek Text of Drs. Westcott and Hort,—which, beyond
all controversy, is more hopelessly remote from the inspired
Original than any which has yet appeared. Let a generation
of Students give themselves entirely up to this neglected
branch of sacred Science. Let 500 more <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Copies</span></span> of the
Gospels, Acts, and Epistles, be diligently collated. Let at
least 100 of the ancient <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Lectionaries</span></em> be very exactly collated
also. Let the most important of the ancient <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Versions</span></span> be
edited afresh, and let the languages in which these are
written be for the first time really <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">mastered</span></em> by Englishmen.
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Above all, let the </span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Fathers</span></span><span style="font-style: italic"> he called upon to give up their
precious secrets.</span></em> Let their writings be ransacked and indexed,
and (where needful) let the MSS. of their works be diligently
inspected, in order that we may know what actually
is the evidence which they afford. Only so will it ever be
possible to obtain a Greek Text on which absolute reliance
may be placed, and which may serve as the basis for a
satisfactory Revision of our Authorized Version. Nay, let
whatever unpublished works of the ancient Greek Fathers are
anywhere known to exist,—(and not a few precious remains
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page126">[pg 126]</span><a name="Pg126" id="Pg126" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of theirs are lying hid in great national libraries, both at
home and abroad,)—let these be printed. The men could
easily be found: the money, far more easily.—When all this
has been done,—<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">not before</span></em>—then in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">God's</span></span> Name, let <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the
Church</span></em> address herself to the great undertaking. Do but
revive the arrangements which were adopted in King James's
days: and we venture to predict that less than a third part
of ten years will be found abundantly to suffice for the work.

of Queen Victoria! Will they not peruse with downright

Reverend Chairman evidently surveys with self-complacency.
First, he invites attention to the Principle and Rule for
their guidance agreed to by the Committee of Convocation
(25th May, 1870), viz. <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">To introduce as few alterations
as possible into the Text of the Authorized Version,
consistently with faithfulness</span></span>.”</span> Words could not be more
emphatic. <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Plain and clear errors</span></span>”</span> were to be corrected.
<span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Necessary</span></span> emendations”</span> were to be made. But (in the
words of the Southern Convocation) <span class="tei tei-q">“We do not contemplate
any new Translation, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">or any alteration of the language</span></em>,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">except where</span></span>, in the judgment of the most competent
Scholars, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">such change is necessary</span></span>.”</span> The watchword,
therefore, given to the company of Revisionists was,—<span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Necessity</span></span>.”</span>
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Necessity</span></em> was to determine whether they were
to depart from the language of the Authorized Version, or
not; for the alterations were to be <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">as few as possible</span></span>.

becomes clear that the Revisers' notion of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">necessity</span></span>
is not that of the rest of mankind. But let the plain Truth
be stated. Certain of them, when remonstrated with by their
fellows for the manifest disregard they were showing to the
Instructions subject to which they had undertaken the work
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page128">[pg 128]</span><a name="Pg128" id="Pg128" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of Revision, are reported to have even gloried in their
shame. The majority, it is clear, have even ostentatiously
set those Instructions at defiance.

Was the course they pursued,—(we ask the question
respectfully,)—strictly <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">honest</span></em>? To decline the work entirely

all events, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">was the Revisionists' word in S. Matth.</span></em> v. 39
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">and S. James</span></em> iv. 7.—Why also substitute <span class="tei tei-q">“the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">race</span></em>”</span> (for <span class="tei tei-q">“the
kindred”</span>) <span class="tei tei-q">“of Joseph”</span> in Acts vii. 13, although γένος was
rendered <span class="tei tei-q">“kindred”</span> in iv. 6?—Do the Revisionists think
that <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">fastening their</span></em> eyes on him”</span> is a better rendering of
ἀτενίσαντες εἰς αὐτόν (Acts vi. 15) than <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">looking stedfastly</span></em> on

xxiii. 1. There, because they found <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">earnestly beholding</span></em> the
council,”</span> they must needs alter the phrase into <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">looking
stedfastly</span></em>.”</span> It is clear therefore that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Caprice</span></em>, not <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Necessity</span></em>,—an

<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">itching impatience</span></em> to introduce changes into the A. V., not
the discovery of <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">plain and clear errors</span></em>”</span>—has determined
the great bulk of the alterations which molest us in every
part of the present unlearned and tasteless performance.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
II. The next point to which the Revisionists direct our
attention is their <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">new Greek text</span></span>,—<span class="tei tei-q">“the necessary foundation
of”</span> their work. And here we must renew our protest against
the wrong which has been done to English readers by the
Revisionists' disregard of the IVth Rule laid down for their
guidance, viz. that, whenever they adopted a new Textual
reading, such alteration was to be <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">indicated in the margin</span></em>.”</span>
This <span class="tei tei-q">“proved inconvenient,”</span> say the Revisionists. Yes, we
reply: but only because you saw fit, in preference, to choke
up your margin with a record of the preposterous readings
you did <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">not</span></em> admit. Even so, however, the thing might to
some extent have been done, if only by a system of signs
in the margin wherever a change in the Text had been by
yourselves effected. And, at whatever <span class="tei tei-q">“inconvenience,”</span> you
were bound to do this,—partly because the Rule before you
was express: but chiefly in fairness to the English Reader.
How comes it to pass that you have <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">never</span></em> furnished him
with the information you stood pledged to furnish; but have
instead, volunteered in every page information, worthless
in itself, which can only serve to unsettle the faith of unlettered
millions, and to suggest unreasonable as well as
miserable doubts to the minds of all?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
For no one may for an instant imagine that the marginal
statements of which we speak are a kind of equivalent for
the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Apparatus Criticus</span></span> which is found in every principal
edition of the Greek Testament—excepting always that of
Drs. Westcott and Hort. So far are we from deprecating
(with Daniel Whitby) the multiplication of <span class="tei tei-q">“Various Readings,”</span>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page131">[pg 131]</span><a name="Pg131" id="Pg131" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
that we rejoice in them exceedingly; knowing that
they are the very foundation of our confidence and the secret
of our strength. For this reason we consider Dr. Tischendorf's
last (8th) edition to be furnished with not nearly
enough of them, though he left all his predecessors (and
himself in his 7th edition) far behind. Our quarrel with the
Revisionists is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">not</span></em> by any means that they have commemorated
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">actual</span></em> <span class="tei tei-q">“alternative Readings”</span> in their margin: but
that, while they have given prominence throughout to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">patent
Errors</span></em>, they <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">have unfairly excluded all mention of,—have not
made the slightest allusion to,—hundreds of Readings which
ought in fact rather to have stood in the Text</span></em>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The marginal readings, which our Revisers have been so
ill-advised as to put prominently forward, and to introduce
to the Reader's notice with the vague statement that they are
sanctioned by <span class="tei tei-q">“Some”</span> (or by <span class="tei tei-q">“Many”</span>) <span class="tei tei-q">“ancient authorities,”</span>—are
specimens <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">arbitrarily selected</span></em> out of an immense mass;
are magisterially recommended to public attention and
favour; <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">seem</span></em> to be invested with the sanction and authority
of Convocation itself. And this becomes a very serious
matter indeed. No hint is given <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">which</span></em> be the <span class="tei tei-q">“ancient
Authorities”</span> so referred to:—nor what proportion they bear
to the <span class="tei tei-q">“ancient Authorities”</span> producible on the opposite side:—nor
whether they are the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">most</span></em> <span class="tei tei-q">“ancient Authorities”</span> obtainable:—nor
what amount of attention their testimony may
reasonably claim. But in the meantime a fatal assertion is
hazarded in the Preface (iii. 1.), to the effect that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in cases
where </span><span class="tei tei-q">“it would not be safe to accept one Reading to the absolute
exclusion of others,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“alternative Readings”</span></em> have been given <span class="tei tei-q">“in
the margin.”</span> So that the <span class="tei tei-q">“Agony and bloody sweat”</span> of the
World's <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Redeemer</span></span> (Lu. xxii. 43, 44),—and His Prayer for His
murderers (xxiii. 34),—and much beside of transcendent
importance and inestimable value, may, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">according to our
Revisionists</span></em>, prove to rest upon no foundation whatever.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page132">[pg 132]</span><a name="Pg132" id="Pg132" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
At all events, <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">it would not be safe</span></em>,”</span> (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">it is not safe</span></em>) to place
absolute reliance on them. Alas, how many a deadly blow
at Revealed Truth hath been in this way aimed with fatal
adroitness, which no amount of orthodox learning will ever
be able hereafter to heal, much less to undo! Thus,—
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">a</span></span>) From the first verse of S. Mark's Gospel we are
informed that <span class="tei tei-q">“Some ancient authorities omit <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the Son of
</span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">God</span></span></em>.”</span> Why are we <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">not</span></em> informed that every known uncial

Version</span></em>,—and the following Fathers,—all <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">contain</span></em> the
precious clause: viz. Irenæus,—Porphyry,—Severianus of
Gabala,—Cyril Alex.,—Victor Ant.,—and others,—besides
Ambrose and Augustine among the Latins:—while the supposed
adverse testimony of Serapion and Titus, Basil and
Victorinus, Cyril of Jer. and Epiphanius, proves to be all
a mistake? To speak plainly, since the clause is above
suspicion, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Why are we not rather told so?</span></em>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">b</span></span>) In the 3rd verse of the first chapter of S. John's
Gospel, we are left to take our choice between,—<span class="tei tei-q">“without
Him was not anything made that hath been made. In him
was life; and the life,”</span> &amp;c.,—and the following absurd alternative,—<span class="tei tei-q">“Without
him was not anything made. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">That which
hath been made was life in him</span></em>; and the life,”</span> &amp;c. But we
are <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">not</span></em> informed that this latter monstrous figment is known
to have been the importation of the Gnostic heretics in the
IInd century, and to be as destitute of authority as it is of
sense. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Why is prominence given only to the lie?</span></em>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">c</span></span>) At S. John iii. 13, we are informed that the last clause
of that famous verse (<span class="tei tei-q">“No man hath ascended up to heaven,
but He that came down from heaven, even the Son of Man—<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">which
is in heaven</span></em>”</span>), is not found in <span class="tei tei-q">“many ancient authorities.”</span>

But why, in the name of common fairness, are we not

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Why then, (it will of course be asked,) is the margin—(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">a</span></span>)
of S. Mark i. 1 and—(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">b</span></span>) of S. John i. 3, and—(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">c</span></span>) of S.
John iii. 13, encumbered after this discreditable fashion?
It is (we answer) only because <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the Text of Drs. Westcott and
Hort</span></em> is thus depraved in all three places. Those Scholars
enjoy the unenviable distinction of having dared to expel
from S. John iii. 13 the words ὁ ὢν ἐν τῷ οὐρανῷ, which
Lachmann, Tregelles and Tischendorf were afraid to touch.
Well may Dean Stanley have bestowed upon Dr. Hort the
epithet of <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">fearless</span></em>”</span>!... If report speaks truly, it is by the

But why is not the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">whole</span></em> Truth told? viz. why are we not

Irenæus (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 170) knew, but rejected; remarking that 666,

therefore—for what possible reason—at the end of 1700
years and upwards, is this, which is so clearly nothing else
but an ancient slip of the pen, to be forced upon the attention
of 90 millions of English-speaking people?

Will Bishop Ellicott and his friends venture to tell us that
it has been done because <span class="tei tei-q">“it would not be safe to accept”</span>

to perplex, mystify, and discourage <span class="tei tei-q">“those that have understanding,”</span>
and would fain <span class="tei tei-q">“count the number of the Beast,”</span>
if they were able? Or was the intention only to insinuate
one more wretched doubt—one more miserable suspicion—into
minds which have been taught (<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">and rightly</span></em>) to place
absolute reliance in the textual accuracy of all the gravest
utterances of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Spirit</span></span>: minds which are utterly incapable
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page137">[pg 137]</span><a name="Pg137" id="Pg137" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of dealing with the subtleties of Textual Criticism; and,
from a one-sided statement like the present, will carry away
none but entirely mistaken inferences, and the most unreasonable
distrust?... Or, lastly, was it only because, in
their opinion, the margin of every Englishman's N. T. is the
fittest place for reviving the memory of obsolete blunders,
and ventilating forgotten perversions of the Truth?... We
really pause for an answer.

(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">e</span></span>) But serious as this is, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">more</span></em> serious (if possible) is the
unfair <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Suppression systematically practised</span></em> throughout the
work before us. <span class="tei tei-q">“We have given alternative Readings in

readers have a right to infer that whenever <span class="tei tei-q">“alternative
Readings”</span> are <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">not</span></em> <span class="tei tei-q">“given in the margin,”</span> it is because
such Readings do <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">not</span></em> <span class="tei tei-q">“seem to be of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sufficient importance or
interest to deserve notice</span></em>.”</span> Will the Revisionists venture to
tell us that,—(to take the first instance of unfair Suppression
which presents itself,)—our <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span></span>'s saying in S. Mark vi. 11
is not <span class="tei tei-q">“of sufficient importance or interest to deserve
notice”</span>? We allude to the famous words,—<span class="tei tei-q">“Verily I say
unto you, It shall be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrah
in the day of judgment, than for that city:”</span>—words which
are not only omitted from the <span class="tei tei-q">“New English Version,”</span> but
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">are not suffered to leave so much as a trace of themselves
in the margin</span></em>. And yet, the saying in question is attested
by the Peschito and the Philoxenian Syriac Versions: by the
Old Latin: by the Coptic, Æthiopic and Gothic Versions:—by
11 uncials and by the whole bulk of the cursives:—by
Irenæus and by Victor of Antioch. So that whether
Antiquity, or Variety of Attestation is considered,—whether
we look for Numbers or for Respectability,—the genuineness
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page138">[pg 138]</span><a name="Pg138" id="Pg138" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of the passage may be regarded as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">certain</span></em>. Our complaint
however is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">not</span></em> that the Revisionists entertain a different
opinion on this head from ourselves: but that they give
the reader to understand that the state of the Evidence is
such, that it is quite <span class="tei tei-q">“safe to accept”</span> the shorter reading,—<span class="tei tei-q">“to
the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">absolute exclusion</span></em> of the other.”</span>—So vast is
the field before us, that this single specimen of what we
venture to call <span class="tei tei-q">“unfair Suppression,”</span> must suffice. (Some
will not hesitate to bestow upon it a harsher epithet.) It
is in truth by far the most damaging feature of the work
before us, that its Authors should have so largely and so
seriously <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">falsified the Deposit</span></em>; and yet, (in clear violation
of the IVth Principle or Rule laid down for their guidance
at the outset,) have suffered no trace to survive in the margin
of the deadly mischief which they have effected.

after all have to stand in the text, although the attentive
student of Scripture would enjoy the knowledge that something
more is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">implied</span></em>. In other words,—the Revisionists
would have done better if they had left both places alone....
These are many words; yet is it impossible to explain
such matters at once satisfactorily and briefly.

(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">b</span></span>) But more painful by far it is to discover that a
morbid striving after etymological accuracy,—added to a
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page145">[pg 145]</span><a name="Pg145" id="Pg145" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
calamitous preference for a depraved Text,—has proved the
ruin of one of the most affecting scenes in S. John's Gospel.
<span class="tei tei-q">“Simon Peter beckoneth to him, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">and saith unto him, Tell us
who it is of whom He speaketh</span></em>”</span> [a fabulous statement evidently;
for Peter beckoned, because he might <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">not</span></em> speak].
<span class="tei tei-q">“He <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">leaning back, as he was</span></em>,”</span>—[a very bad rendering of οὕτως,
by the way; and sure to recal inopportunely the rendering
of ὡς ἦν in S. Mark iv. 36, instead of suggesting (as it
obviously ought) the original of S. John iv. 6:]—<span class="tei tei-q">“on <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Jesus</span></span>'
breast, saith unto Him, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span></span> who is it?”</span> (S. John xiii. 24-5).
Now, S. John's word concerning himself in this place is
certainly ἐπιπεσών. He <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">just sank</span></em>”</span>—let his head <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">fall</span></em>”</span>—on
his Master's breast, and whispered his question. For this, a
few corrupt copies substitute ἀναπεσών. But ἀναπεσών <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">never</span></em>
means <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">leaning back</span></em>.”</span> It is descriptive of the posture of one
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">reclining at a meal</span></em> (S. Jo. xiii. 12). Accordingly, it is 10 times
rendered by the Revisionists to <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sit down</span></em>.”</span> Why, in this
place, and in chapter xxi. 20, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">a new meaning</span></em> is thrust upon
the word, it is for the Revisionists to explain. But they
must explain the matter a vast deal better than Bp. Lightfoot
has done in his interesting little work on Revision (pp. 72-3),
or they will fail to persuade any,—except one another.

discovery that changes have been made <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">for the worse</span></em>, offends
greatly. To take instances at random:—'Ὁ πλεῖστος ὄχλος

<span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the most part of</span></em> the multitude”</span>?—Ὁ πολὺς ὄχλος (Mk. xii.
37), in like manner, is rightly rendered <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the common people</span></em>,”</span>
and ought not to have been glossed in the margin <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the great
multitude</span></em>.”</span>—In the R. V. of Acts x. 15, we find <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Make</span></em> thou
not common,”</span> introduced as an improvement on, <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">That call</span></em>
not thou common.”</span> But <span class="tei tei-q">“the old is better:”</span> for, besides its
idiomatic and helpful <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">That</span></em>,”</span>—the old alone states the case
truly. Peter did not <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">make</span></em>,”</span> he only <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">called</span></em>,”</span> something
<span class="tei tei-q">“common.”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“All the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">male</span></em> children,”</span> as a translation of πάντας
τοὺς παῖδας (in Matth. ii. 16) is an unauthorized statement.
There is no reason for supposing that the female infants of
Bethlehem were spared in the general massacre: and the
Greek certainly conveys no such information.—<span class="tei tei-q">“When he
came into the house, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Jesus</span></span> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">spake first</span></em> to him”</span>—is really an
incorrect rendering of Matth. xvii. 25: at least, it imports
into the narrative a notion which is not found in the Greek,
and does not exhibit faithfully what the Evangelist actually
says. <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Anticipated</span></em>,”</span> in modern English,—<span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">prevented</span></em>,”</span> in
ancient phraseology,—<span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">was beforehand with him</span></em>”</span> in language
neither new nor old,—conveys the sense of the original
exactly.—In S. Lu. vi. 35, <span class="tei tei-q">“Love your enemies, ... and lend,
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">never despairing</span></em>,”</span> is simply a mistaken translation of ἀπελπίζοντες,
as the context sufficiently proves. The old rendering
is the true one.<a id="noteref_484" name="noteref_484" href="#note_484"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">484</span></span></a> And so, learnedly, the Vulgate,—<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">nihil inde

(<span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">save</span></em>”</span> in place of <span class="tei tei-q">“but”</span>) in Gal. ii. 16 has been ably and

(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">d</span></span>) We should be dealing insincerely with our Readers were
we to conceal our grave dissatisfaction at not a few of the
novel <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">expressions</span></em> which the Revisionists have sought to
introduce into the English New Testament. That the
malefactors between whom <span class="tei tei-q">“the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span></span> of glory”</span> was crucified
were not ordinary <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">thieves</span></em>”</span> is obvious; yet would it have
been wiser, we think, to leave the old designation undisturbed.
We shall never learn to call them <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">robbers</span></em>.”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“The

translation of S. Mark vi. 27. <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">An executioner</span></em>”</span> surely is far
preferable as the equivalent for σπεκουλάτωρ!<a id="noteref_485" name="noteref_485" href="#note_485"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">485</span></span></a>—<span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Assassins</span></em>”</span>

romantic chapter in the history of the Crusades”</span><a id="noteref_486" name="noteref_486" href="#note_486"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">486</span></span></a> has
no business in the N. T.—And what did these learned men
suppose they should gain by substituting <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the twin brothers</span></em>”</span>
for <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Castor and Pollux</span></em>”</span> in Acts xxviii. 11? The Greek
(Διόσκουροι) is neither the one nor the other.—In the same
spirit, instead of, <span class="tei tei-q">“they that received <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">tribute-money</span></em>”</span> (in
S. Matth. xvii. 24), we are now presented with <span class="tei tei-q">“they that
received <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the half-shekel</span></em>:”</span> and in verse 27,—instead of
<span class="tei tei-q">“when thou hast opened his mouth, thou shalt find <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">a
piece of money</span></em>,”</span> we are favoured with <span class="tei tei-q">“thou shalt find <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">a
shekel</span></em>.”</span> But <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">why</span></em> the change has been made, we fail to see.
The margin is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">still</span></em> obliged to explain that not one of these
four words is found in the original: the Greek in the former
place being τὰ δίδραχμα,—in the latter, στατήρ.—<span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Flute-players</span></em>”</span>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page148">[pg 148]</span><a name="Pg148" id="Pg148" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
(for <span class="tei tei-q">“minstrels”</span>) in S. Matthew ix. 23, is a mistake.
An αὐλητής played <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the pipe</span></em> (αὐλός, 1 Cor. xiv. 7),—hence
<span class="tei tei-q">“pipers”</span> in Rev. xviii. 22; (where by the way μουσικοί
[<span class="tei tei-q">“musicians”</span>] is perversely and less accurately rendered <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">minstrels</span></em>”</span>).—Once
more. <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Undressed</span></em> cloth”</span> (Mk. ii. 21), because
it is an expression popularly understood only in certain
districts of England, and a <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">vox artis</span></span>, ought not to have been
introduced into the Gospels. <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">New</span></em>”</span> is preferable.—<span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Wine-skins</span></em>”</span>
(Mtt. ix. 17: Mk. ii. 22: Lu. v. 37) is a term unintelligible
to the generality; as the Revisionists confess, for
they explain it by a note,—<span class="tei tei-q">“That is, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">skins used as bottles</span></em>.”</span>
What else is this but substituting a new difficulty for an old
one?—<span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Silver</span></em>,”</span> now for the first time thrust into Acts viii.
20, is unreasonable. Like <span class="tei tei-q">“argent”</span> in French, ἀργύριον as
much means <span class="tei tei-q">“money,”</span> here as in S. Matthew xxv. 18, 27,
&amp;c.—In S. James ii. 19, we should like to know what is
gained by the introduction of the <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">shuddering</span></em>”</span> devils.—To
take an example from a different class of words,—Who
will say that <span class="tei tei-q">“Thou <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">mindest</span></em> not the things of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">God</span></span>”</span> is a better
rendering of οὐ φρονεῖς, than the old <span class="tei tei-q">“Thou <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">savourest</span></em> not,”</span>—which
at least had no ambiguity about it?... A friend
points out that Dr. Field (a <span class="tei tei-q">“master in Israel”</span>) has examined
104 of the changes <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">made</span></em> in the Revised Version; and finds
8 questionable: 13 unnecessary: 19 faulty (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> cases in
which the A. V. required amendment, but which the R. V.
has not succeeded in amending): 64 <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">changes for the worse</span></em>.<a id="noteref_487" name="noteref_487" href="#note_487"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">487</span></span></a>...
This is surely a terrible indictment for such an one as Dr.
Field to bring against the Revisers,—<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">who were directed only
to correct</span></em> <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">plain and clear errors</span></span>.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">e</span></span>) We really fail to understand how it has come to
pass that, notwithstanding the amount of scholarship which
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page149">[pg 149]</span><a name="Pg149" id="Pg149" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
sometimes sat in the Jerusalem Chamber, so many novelties
are found in the present Revision which betoken a want
of familiarity with the refinements of the Greek language
on the one hand; and (what is even more inexcusable) only
a slender acquaintance with the resources and proprieties
of English speech, on the other. A fair average instance
of this occurs in Acts xxi. 37, where (instead of <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Canst</span></em>
thou <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">speak</span></em> Greek?”</span>) Ἑλληνιστὶ γινώσκεις? is rendered <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Dost</span></em>
thou <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">know</span></em> Greek?”</span> That γινώσκειν means <span class="tei tei-q">“to know”</span> (and
not <span class="tei tei-q">“to speak”</span>) is undeniable: and yet, in the account of
all, except the driest and stupidest of pedagogues, Ἑλληνιστὶ
γινώσκεις; must be translated <span class="tei tei-q">“Canst thou <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">speak</span></em> Greek?”</span>
For (as every schoolboy is aware) Ἑλληνιστί is an adverb,
and signifies <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in Greek fashion</span></em>:”</span> so that something has to be
supplied: and the full expression, if it must needs be given,
would be, <span class="tei tei-q">“Dost thou know [how to talk] in Greek?”</span> But
then, this condensation of phrase proves to be the established
idiom of the language:<a id="noteref_488" name="noteref_488" href="#note_488"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">488</span></span></a> so that the rejection of the learned
rendering of Tyndale, Cranmer, the Geneva, the Rheims,
and the Translators of 1611 (<span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Canst thou speak</span></em> Greek?”</span>)—the
rejection of this, at the end of 270 years, in favour of
<span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Dost thou know</span></em> Greek?”</span> really betrays ignorance. It is worse
than bad Taste. It is a stupid and deliberate <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">blunder</span></em>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">f</span></span>) The substitution of <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">they weighed unto him</span></em>”</span> (in place
of <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">they covenanted with him for</span></em>”</span>) <span class="tei tei-q">“thirty pieces of silver”</span>
(S. Matth. xxvi. 15) is another of those plausible mistakes,
into which a little learning (proverbially <span class="tei tei-q">“a dangerous thing”</span>)
is for ever conducting its unfortunate possessor; but from
which it was to have been expected that the undoubted
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page150">[pg 150]</span><a name="Pg150" id="Pg150" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
attainments of some who frequented the Jerusalem Chamber
would have effectually preserved the Revisionists. That
ἔστησαν is intended to recal Zech. xi. 12, is obvious; as
well as that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">there</span></em> it refers to the ancient practice of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">weighing</span></em>
uncoined money. It does not, however, by any means
follow, that it was customary to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">weigh</span></em> shekels in the days
of the Gospel. Coined money, in fact, was never weighed,
but always counted; and these were shekels, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">didrachms</span></em>
(Matth. xvii. 24). The truth (it lies on the surface) is, that
there exists a happy ambiguity about the word ἔστησαν,
of which the Evangelist has not been slow to avail himself.
In the particular case before us, it is expressly recorded that
in the first instance money did <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">not</span></em> pass,—only a bargain was
made, and a certain sum promised. S. Mark's record is that
the chief priests were glad at the proposal of Judas, <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">and
promised</span></em> to give him money”</span> (xiv. 11): S. Luke's, that <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">they
covenanted</span></em>”</span> to do so (xxii. 5, 6). And with this, the statement
of the first Evangelist is found to be in strictest
agreement. The chief Priests <span class="tei tei-q">“set”</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">“appointed”</span><a id="noteref_489" name="noteref_489" href="#note_489"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">489</span></span></a> him
a certain sum. The perfectly accurate rendering of S. Matth.
xxvi. 15, therefore, exhibited by our Authorized Version, has
been set aside to make way for <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">a misrepresentation of the
Evangelist's meaning</span></em>. <span class="tei tei-q">“In the judgment of the most competent
scholars,”</span> was <span class="tei tei-q">“such change <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">necessary</span></span>”</span>?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">g</span></span>) We respectfully think that it would have been more
becoming in such a company as that which assembled in the
Jerusalem Chamber, as well as more consistent with their
Instructions, if <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in doubtful cases</span></em> they had abstained from
touching the Authorized Version, but had recorded their own
conjectural emendations <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in the margin</span></em>. How rash and infelicitous,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page151">[pg 151]</span><a name="Pg151" id="Pg151" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
for example, is the following rendering of the
famous words in Acts xxvi. 28, 29, which we find thrust
upon us without apology or explanation; without, in fact,
any marginal note at all:—<span class="tei tei-q">“And Agrippa said unto Paul,
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">With but little persuasion thou wouldest fain make me</span></em> a
Christian. And Paul said, I would to <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">God</span></span>, that whether
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">with little or with much</span></em>,”</span> &amp;c. Now this is indefensible. For,
in the first place, to get any such meaning out of the words,
our Revisionists have been obliged to substitute the fabricated
ποιῆσαι (the peculiar property of א <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a b</span></span> and a few
cursives) for γενέσθαι in ver. 28. Moreover, even so, the
words do not yield the required sense. We venture to point
out, that this is precisely one of the occasions where the
opinion of a first-rate Greek Father is of paramount importance.
The moderns confess themselves unable to discover
a single instance of the phrase ἐν ὀλίγῳ in the sense of <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">within
a little</span></em>.”</span> Cyril of Jerusalem (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 350) and Chrysostom
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 400), on the contrary, evidently considered that here
the expression can mean nothing else; and they were competent
judges, seeing that Greek was their native language:
far better judges (be it remarked in passing) on a point of
this kind than the whole body of Revisionists put together.
<span class="tei tei-q">“Such an amount of victorious grace and wisdom did Paul
derive from the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Holy Spirit</span></span>”</span> (says Cyril), <span class="tei tei-q">“that even King
Agrippa at last exclaimed,”</span><a id="noteref_490" name="noteref_490" href="#note_490"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">490</span></span></a> &amp;c. From which it is evident
that Cyril regarded Agrippa's words as an avowal that he
was well-nigh overcome by the Apostle's argument. And so
Chrysostom,<a id="noteref_491" name="noteref_491" href="#note_491"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">491</span></span></a> who says plainly that ἐν ὀλίγῳ means <span class="tei tei-q">“within
a little,”</span><a id="noteref_492" name="noteref_492" href="#note_492"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">492</span></span></a> and assumes that <span class="tei tei-q">“within a little”</span> S. Paul had
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page152">[pg 152]</span><a name="Pg152" id="Pg152" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
persuaded his judge.<a id="noteref_493" name="noteref_493" href="#note_493"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">493</span></span></a> He even puts παρ᾽ ὀλίγον into Agrippa's
mouth.<a id="noteref_494" name="noteref_494" href="#note_494"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">494</span></span></a> So also, in effect, Theodoret.<a id="noteref_495" name="noteref_495" href="#note_495"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">495</span></span></a> From all which it is
reasonable, in the absence of any evidence to the contrary, to
infer that our A. V. reflects faithfully what was the Church's
traditionary interpretation of Acts xxvi. 28 in the first half
of the fourth century. Let it only be added that a better
judge of such matters than any who frequented the Jerusalem
Chamber—the late President of Magdalen, Dr. Routh,—writes:
<span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Vertendum esse sequentia suadent, Me fere Christianum
fieri suades. Interp. Vulgata habet, In modico suades
me Christianum fieri.</span></span>”</span><a id="noteref_496" name="noteref_496" href="#note_496"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">496</span></span></a> Yes, the Apostle's rejoinder fixes the
meaning of what Agrippa had said before.—And this shall
suffice. We pass on, only repeating our devout wish that
what the Revisionists failed to understand, or were unable
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">materially and certainly</span></em> to improve, they would have been
so obliging as to let alone. In the present instance the A. V.
is probably right; the R. V., probably wrong. No one, at all
events, can pretend that the rendering with which we are all
familiar is <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">a plain and clear error</span></em>.”</span> And confessedly, unless
it was, it should have been left unmolested. But to proceed.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(4) and (5) There can be no question as to the absolute
duty of rendering identical expressions <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in strictly parallel
places of the Gospels</span></em> by strictly identical language. So far we
are wholly at one with the Revisionists. But <span class="tei tei-q">“alterations
[supposed to be] rendered necessary <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">by consequence</span></em>”</span> (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Preface</span></span>,
iii. 2.), are quite a different matter: and we venture to think
that it is precisely in their pursuit of a mechanical uniformity
of rendering, that our Revisionists have most often as well as
most grievously lost their way. We differ from them in fact
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">in limine</span></span>. <span class="tei tei-q">“When a particular word”</span> (say they) <span class="tei tei-q">“is found to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page153">[pg 153]</span><a name="Pg153" id="Pg153" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
recur with characteristic frequency in any one of the Sacred
Writers, it is obviously desirable to adopt for it some uniform
rendering”</span> (iii. 2). <span class="tei tei-q">“Desirable”</span>! Yes, but in what sense?
It is much to be desired, no doubt, that the English language
always contained <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the exact counterparts</span></em> of Greek words: and
of course, if it did, it would be in the highest degree <span class="tei tei-q">“desirable”</span>
that a Translator should always employ those words and
no other. But then it happens unfortunately that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">precisely
equivalent words do not exist</span></em>. Τέκνον, nine times out of ten
signifies nothing else but <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">child</span></em>.”</span> On the tenth occasion,
however, (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">e.g.</span></span> where Abraham is addressing the rich man
in Hades,) it would be absurd so to render it. We translate
<span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Son</span></em>.”</span> We are in fact without choice.—Take another ordinary
Greek term, σπλάγχνα, which occurs 11 times in the N. T.,
and which the A. V. uniformly renders <span class="tei tei-q">“bowels.”</span> Well, and
<span class="tei tei-q">“bowels”</span> confessedly σπλάγχνα are. Yet have our Revisionists
felt themselves under the <span class="tei tei-q">“necessity”</span> of rendering the
word <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">heart</span></em>,”</span> in Col. iii. 12,—<span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">very heart</span></em>,”</span> in Philemon,
ver. 12,—<span class="tei tei-q">“affections”</span> in 2 Cor. vi. 12,—<span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">inward affection</span></em>,”</span>
in vii. 15,—<span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">tender mercies</span></em>”</span> in Phil. i. 8,—<span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">compassion</span></em>”</span> in
1 Jo. iii. 17,—<span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">bowels</span></em>”</span> only in Acts i. 18.—These learned
men, however, put forward in illustration of their own principle
of translation, the word εὐθέως,—which occurs about 80
times in the N. T.: nearly half the instances being found in
S. Mark's Gospel. We accept their challenge; and assert
that it is tasteless barbarism to seek to impose upon εὐθέως,—no
matter <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">what</span></em> the context in which it stands,—the sense of
<span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">straightway</span></em>,”</span>—only because εὐθύς, the adjective, generally
(not always) means <span class="tei tei-q">“straight.”</span> Where a miracle of healing
is described (as in S. Matth. viii. 3: xx. 34. S. Lu. v. 13), since
the benefit was no doubt instantaneous, it is surely the mere
instinct of <span class="tei tei-q">“faithfulness”</span> to translate εὐθέως <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">immediately</span></em>.”</span>
So, in respect of the sudden act which saved Peter from
sinking (S. Matth. xiv. 31); and that punctual cock-crow
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page154">[pg 154]</span><a name="Pg154" id="Pg154" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
(xxvi. 74), which (S. Luke says) did not so much follow,
as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">accompany</span></em> his denial (xxii. 60). But surely not so, when
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the growth of a seed</span></em> is the thing spoken of (Matth. xiii. 5)!
Acts again, which must needs have occupied some little time
in the doing, reasonably suggest some such rendering as
<span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">forthwith</span></em>”</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">straightway</span></em>,”</span>—(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">e.g.</span></span> S. Matth. xiv. 22: xxi. 2:
and S. John vi. 21): while, in 3 John ver. 14, the meaning
(as the Revisionists confess) can only be <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">shortly</span></em>.”</span>... So plain
a matter really ought not to require so many words. We
repeat, that the Revisionists set out with a mistaken
Principle. They clearly <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">do not understand their Trade</span></em>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
They invite our attention to their rendering of certain
of the Greek Tenses, and of the definite Article. We
regret to discover that, in both respects, their work is
disfigured throughout by changes which convict a majority
of their body alike of an imperfect acquaintance with
the genius of the Greek language, and of scarcely a moderate
appreciation of the idiomatic proprieties of their own.
Such a charge must of necessity, when it has been substantiated,
press heavily upon such a work as the present;
for it is not as when a solitary error has been detected,
which may be rectified. A vicious <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">system</span></em> of rendering
Tenses, and representing the Greek Article, is sure to crop
up in every part of the undertaking, and must occasionally
be attended by consequences of a serious nature.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
1. Now, that we may not be misunderstood, we admit
at once that, in teaching <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">boys</span></em> how to turn Greek into English,
we insist that every tense shall be marked by its own appropriate
sign. There is no telling how helpful it will prove
in the end, that every word shall at first have been rendered
with painful accuracy. Let the Article be [mis-]represented—the
Prepositions caricatured—the Particles magnified,—let
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page155">[pg 155]</span><a name="Pg155" id="Pg155" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the very order of the words at first, (however impossible,)
be religiously retained. Merciless accuracy having been in
this way acquired, a youth has to be <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">un</span></em>taught these servile
habits. He has to be reminded of the requirements of the
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">English idiom</span></em>, and speedily becomes aware that the idiomatic
rendering of a Greek author into English, is a higher achievement
by far, than his former slavish endeavour always to
render the same word and tense in the same slavish way.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
2. But what supremely annoys us in the work just now
under review is, that the schoolboy method of translation
already noticed is therein exhibited in constant operation
throughout. It becomes oppressive. We are never permitted
to believe that we are in the company of Scholars
who are altogether masters of their own language. Their
solicitude ever seems to be twofold:—(1) To exhibit a singular
indifference to the proprieties of English speech, while they
maintain a servile adherence (etymological or idiomatic, as
the case may be) to the Greek:—(2) Right or wrong, to part
company from William Tyndale and the giants who gave us
our <span class="tei tei-q">“Authorized Version.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Take a few illustrations of what precedes from the second
chapter of S. Matthew's Gospel:—
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(1.) Thus, in ver. 2, the correct English rendering <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">we
have seen</span></em>”</span> is made to give place to the incorrect <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">we saw</span></em>
his star in the east.”</span>—In ver. 9, the idiomatic <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">when they
had heard the king</span></em>, they departed,”</span> is rejected for the unidiomatic
<span class="tei tei-q">“And they, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">having heard the king</span></em>, went their way.”</span>—In
ver. 15, we are treated to <span class="tei tei-q">“that it might be fulfilled
which was spoken by the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span></span> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">through</span></em> the prophet, saying,
Out of Egypt <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">did I call</span></em> my son.”</span> And yet who sees not,
that in both instances the old rendering is better? Important
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page156">[pg 156]</span><a name="Pg156" id="Pg156" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
as it may be, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in the lecture-room</span></em>, to insist on what is
implied by τὸ ῥηθὲν ὙΠῸ τοῦ κυρίου ΔΙᾺ τοῦ προφήτου, it is
simply preposterous to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">come abroad</span></em> with such refinements.
It is to stultify oneself and to render one's author unintelligible.
Moreover, the attempt to be so wondrous literal
is safe to break down at the end of a few verses. Thus, if
διά is <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">through</span></em>”</span> in verse 15,—why not in verse 17 and in
verse 23?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(2.) Note how infelicitously, in S. Matth. ii. 1, <span class="tei tei-q">“there came
wise men from the east”</span> is changed into <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">wise men from the
east came</span></em>.”</span>—In ver. 4, the accurate, <span class="tei tei-q">“And when [Herod] had
gathered together”</span> (συναγαγών) &amp;c., is displaced for the
inaccurate, <span class="tei tei-q">“And <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">gathering together</span></em>”</span> &amp;c.—In ver. 6, we are
presented with the unintelligible, <span class="tei tei-q">“And thou <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Bethlehem, land
of Judah</span></em>:”</span> while in ver. 7, <span class="tei tei-q">“Then Herod <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">privily called</span></em> the
wise men, and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">learned of them carefully</span></em>,”</span> is improperly put
in the place of <span class="tei tei-q">“Then Herod, when he had privily called
the wise men, enquired of them diligently”</span> (ἠκρίβωσε παρ᾽
αὐτῶν).—In ver. 11, the familiar <span class="tei tei-q">“And when they were come
into the house, they saw”</span> &amp;c., is needlessly changed into
<span class="tei tei-q">“They <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">came into the house</span></em>, and saw:”</span> while <span class="tei tei-q">“and when they
had opened (ἀνοίξαντες) their treasures,”</span> is also needlessly
altered into <span class="tei tei-q">“and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">opening</span></em> their treasures.”</span>—In ver. 12, the
R. V. is careful to print <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">of </span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">God</span></span></em>”</span> in italics, where italics are
not necessary: seeing that χρηματισθέντες implies <span class="tei tei-q">“being
warned of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">God</span></span>”</span> (as the translators of 1611 were well
aware<a id="noteref_497" name="noteref_497" href="#note_497"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">497</span></span></a>): whereas in countless other places the same Revisionists
reject the use of italics where italics are absolutely
required.—Their <span class="tei tei-q">“until I <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">tell thee</span></em>”</span> (in ver. 13) is a most
unworthy substitute for <span class="tei tei-q">“until I <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">bring thee word</span></em>.”</span>—And will
they pretend that they have improved the rendering of the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page157">[pg 157]</span><a name="Pg157" id="Pg157" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
concluding words of the chapter? If Ναζωραῖος κληθήσεται
does not mean <span class="tei tei-q">“He shall be called a Nazarene,”</span> what in the
world <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">does</span></em> it mean? The ὅτι of quotation they elsewhere
omit. Then why, here,—<span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">That</span></em> it might be fulfilled ... <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">that</span></em>”</span>?—Surely,
every one of these is an alteration made for alteration's
sake, and in every instance <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">for the worse</span></em>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We began by surveying <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the Greek</span></em> of the first chapter of
S. Matthew's Gospel. We have now surveyed <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the English</span></em> of
the second chapter. What does the Reader think of the result?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
IV. Next, the Revisionists invite attention to certain
points of detail: and first, to their rendering of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">the Tenses
of the Verb</span></span>. They begin with the Greek Aorist,—(in
their account) <span class="tei tei-q">“perhaps the most important”</span> detail of all:—

by forms of expression which it would not bear. But we have
often ventured to represent the Greek aorist by the English
preterite, even when the reader may find some passing difficulty
in such a rendering, because we have felt convinced that the
true meaning of the original was obscured by the presence of
the familiar auxiliary. A remarkable illustration may be
found in the seventeenth chapter of S. John's Gospel.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%">—</span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">Preface</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%">,

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">a</span></span>) We turn to the place indicated, and are constrained
to assure these well-intentioned men, that the phenomenon
we there witness is absolutely fatal to their pretensions
as <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Revisers</span></span>”</span> of our Authorized Version. Were it only <span class="tei tei-q">“some
passing difficulty”</span> which their method occasions us, we
might have hoped that time would enable us to overcome
it. But since it is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the genius of the English language</span></em> to
which we find they have offered violence; the fixed and
universally-understood idiom of our native tongue which
they have systematically set at defiance; the matter is
absolutely without remedy. The difference between the
A. V. and the R. V. seems to ourselves to be simply this,—that
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page158">[pg 158]</span><a name="Pg158" id="Pg158" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the renderings in the former are the idiomatic English
representations of certain well-understood Greek tenses:
while the proposed substitutes are nothing else but the
pedantic efforts of mere grammarians to reproduce in another
language idioms which it abhors. But the Reader
shall judge for himself: for <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">this</span></em> at least is a point on which
every educated Englishman is fully competent to pass
sentence.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
When our Divine <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span></span>, at the close of His Ministry,—(He
had in fact reached the very last night of His earthly
life, and it wanted but a few hours of His Passion,)—when
He, at such a moment, addressing the Eternal <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Father</span></span>, says,
ἐγώ σε ἐδόξασα ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς; τὸ ἔργον ἐτελείωσα ...
ἐφανέρωσά σου τὸ ὄνομα τοῖς ἀνθρώποις, &amp;c. [Jo. xvii. 4, 6],
there can be no doubt whatever that, had He pronounced
those words in English, He would have said (with our A. V.)
<span class="tei tei-q">“I <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">have glorified</span></em> Thee on the earth: I <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">have finished</span></em> the
work:”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“I <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">have manifested</span></em> Thy Name.”</span> The pedantry which
(on the plea that the Evangelist employs the aorist, not the
perfect tense,) would twist all this into the indefinite past,—<span class="tei tei-q">“I
glorified”</span> ... <span class="tei tei-q">“I finished”</span> ... <span class="tei tei-q">“I manifested,”</span>—we pronounce
altogether insufferable. We absolutely refuse it a hearing.
Presently (in ver. 14) He says,—<span class="tei tei-q">“I have given them Thy
word; and the world <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">hath hated them</span></em>.”</span> And in ver. 25,—<span class="tei tei-q">“O

Thee not, but I knew Thee; and these knew that Thou didst
send Me”</span>?—Or turn to another Gospel. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Which</span></em> is better,—<span class="tei tei-q">“Some
one hath touched Me: for I perceive that virtue is
gone out of Me,”</span> (S. Lu. viii. 46):—or,—<span class="tei tei-q">“Some one <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">did touch</span></em>

<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Which</span></em> is better in S. Matth. xvi. 7:—<span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">we took</span></em> no bread,”</span> or
<span class="tei tei-q">“It is because <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">we have taken</span></em> no bread”</span>?—Again. When Simon
Peter (in reply to the command that he should thrust out
into deep water and let down his net for a draught,) is heard
to exclaim,—<span class="tei tei-q">“Master, we have toiled all the night, and have
taken nothing: nevertheless at Thy word I will let down
the net”</span> (Lu. v. 5),—<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">who</span></em> would tolerate the proposal to put
in the place of it,—<span class="tei tei-q">“Master, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">we toiled all night</span></em>, and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">took</span></em>
nothing: but at Thy word,”</span> &amp;c. It is not too much to
declare that the idiom of the English language refuses
peremptorily to submit to such handling. Quite in vain
is it to encounter us with reminder that κοπιάσαντες and
ἐλάβομεν are aorists. The answer is,—We know it: but we
deny that it follows that the words are to be rendered <span class="tei tei-q">“we
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">toiled</span></em> all night, and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">took</span></em> nothing.”</span> There are laws of
English Idiom as well as laws of Greek Grammar: and when
these clash in what is meant to be a translation into English
out of Greek, the latter must perforce give way to the former,—or
we make ourselves ridiculous, and misrepresent what we
propose to translate.

All this is so undeniable that it ought not to require to be
insisted upon. But in fact our Revisionists by their occasional
practice show that they fully admit <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the Principle</span></em> we
are contending for. Thus, ἧραν (in S. Jo. xx. 2 and 13) is

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page160">[pg 160]</span><a name="Pg160" id="Pg160" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
(S. Jo. x. 32) <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">have I showed</span></em>:”</span>—ἀπέστειλε (vi. 29) <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">He hath

<span class="tei tei-q">“He <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">hath appointed</span></em>.”</span> But indeed instances abound everywhere.
In fact, the requirements of the case are often observed
to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">force</span></em> them to be idiomatic. Τί ἐποίησας; (in Jo. xviii. 35),
they rightly render <span class="tei tei-q">“What <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">hast</span></em> thou done?”</span>:—and ἔγραψα
(in 1 Jo. ii. 14, 21), <span class="tei tei-q">“I <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">have</span></em> written;”</span>—and ἤκουσα (in Acts
ix. 13), <span class="tei tei-q">“I <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">have</span></em> heard.”</span>—On the other hand, by translating οὐκ
εἴασεν (in Acts xxviii. 4), <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">hath not suffered</span></em>,”</span> they may be
thought to have overshot the mark. They seem to have
overlooked the fact that, when once S. Paul had been bitten
by the viper, <span class="tei tei-q">“the barbarians”</span> looked upon him as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">a dead
man</span></em>; and therefore discoursed about what Justice <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">did not</span></em>
suffer,”</span> as about an entirely past transaction.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But now, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Who</span></em> sees not that the admission, once and
again deliberately made, that sometimes it is not only
lawful, but even <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">necessary</span></em>, to accommodate the Greek aorist
(when translated into English) with the sign of the perfect,—reduces
the whole matter (of the signs of the tenses) to a
mere question of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Taste</span></em>? In view of such instances as the
foregoing, where severe logical necessity has compelled the
Revisionists to abandon their position and fly, it is plain that
their contention is at an end,—so far as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">right</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">wrong</span></em> are
concerned. They virtually admit that they have been all
along unjustly forcing on an independent language an alien
yoke.<a id="noteref_499" name="noteref_499" href="#note_499"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">499</span></span></a> Henceforth, it simply becomes a question to be
repeated, as every fresh emergency arises,—Which then is
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the more idiomatic</span></em> of these two English renderings?...
Conversely, twice at least (Heb. xi. 17 and 28), the Revisionists
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page161">[pg 161]</span><a name="Pg161" id="Pg161" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
have represented the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Greek perfect</span></em> by the English
indefinite preterite.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">b</span></span>) Besides this offensive pedantry in respect of the
Aorist, we are often annoyed by an <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">unidiomatic</span></em> rendering of
the Imperfect. True enough it is that <span class="tei tei-q">“the servants and the
officers <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">were standing</span></em> ... and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">were warming</span></em> themselves:”</span>
Peter also <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">was standing</span></em> with them and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">was warming</span></em> himself”</span>
(S. Jo. xviii. 18). But we do not so express ourselves in
English, unless we are about to add something which shall
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">account for</span></em> our particularity and precision. Any one, for
example, desirous of stating what had been for years his
daily practice, would say—<span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">I left</span></em> my house.”</span> Only when he
wanted to explain that, on leaving it for the 1000th time, he
met a friend coming up the steps to pay him a visit,
would an Englishman think of saying, <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">I was leaving</span></em> the
house.”</span> A Greek writer, on the other hand, would not <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">trust</span></em>
this to the imperfect. He would use the present participle
in the dative case, (<span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">To me, leaving my house</span></em>,”</span><a id="noteref_500" name="noteref_500" href="#note_500"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">500</span></span></a> &amp;c.). One is
astonished to have to explain such things.... <span class="tei tei-q">“If therefore
thou <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">art offering</span></em> thy gift at the altar”</span> (Matt. v. 23), may
seem to some a clever translation. To ourselves, it reads
like a senseless exaggeration of the original.<a id="noteref_501" name="noteref_501" href="#note_501"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">501</span></span></a> It sounds
(and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">is</span></em>) as unnatural as to say (in S. Lu. ii. 33) <span class="tei tei-q">“And His
father [a depravation of the text] and His mother <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">were marvelling</span></em>
at the things which were spoken concerning Him:”</span>—or
(in Heb. xi. 17) <span class="tei tei-q">“yea, he that had received the promises
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">was offering up</span></em> his only-begotten son:”</span>—or, of the cripple at
Lystra (Acts xiv. 9), <span class="tei tei-q">“the same heard Paul <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">speaking</span></em>.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">c</span></span>) On the other hand, there are occasions confessedly
when the Greek Aorist absolutely demands to be rendered
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page162">[pg 162]</span><a name="Pg162" id="Pg162" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
into English by the sign of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Pluperfect</span></em>. An instance
meets us while we write: ὡς δὲ ἐπαύσατο λαλῶν (S. Lu. v. 4),—where
our Revisionists are found to retain the idiomatic
rendering of our Authorized Version,—<span class="tei tei-q">“When He <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">had left</span></em>
speaking.”</span> Of what possible avail could it be, on such an
occasion, to insist that, because ἐπαύσατο is not in the
pluperfect tense, it may not be accommodated with <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the sign</span></em>
of the pluperfect when it is being translated into English?—The
R. V. has shown less consideration in S. Jo. xviii. 24,—where
<span class="tei tei-q">“Now Annas <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">had sent</span></em> Him bound unto Caiaphas the
high priest,”</span> is right, and wanted no revision.—Such places as
Matth. xxvii. 60, Jo. xxi. 15, Acts xii. 17, and Heb. iv. 8,
on the other hand, simply defy the Revisionists. For perforce
Joseph <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">had hewn</span></em> out”</span> (ἐλατόμησε) the new tomb
which became our <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord's</span></span>: and the seven Apostles, confessedly,
<span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">had dined</span></em>”</span> (ἠρίστησαν): and S. Peter, of course, <span class="tei tei-q">“declared
unto them how the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span></span> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">had brought him out</span></em> of the prison”</span>
(ἐξήγαγεν): and it is impossible to substitute anything for
<span class="tei tei-q">“If Jesus [Joshua] <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">had given</span></em> them rest”</span> (κατέπαυσεν).—Then
of course there are occasions, (not a few,) where the
Aorist (often an indefinite present in Greek) claims to be
Englished by the sign of the present tense: as where S. John
says (Rev. xix. 6), <span class="tei tei-q">“The <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord God</span></span> Omnipotent reigneth”</span>
(ἐβασίλευσε). There is no striving against such instances.
They <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">insist</span></em> on being rendered according to the genius of the
language into which it is proposed to render them:—as when
ἔκειτο (in S. Jo. xx. 12) exacts for its rendering <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">had lain</span></em>.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">d</span></span>) It shall only be pointed out here in addition, for the
student's benefit, that there is one highly interesting place
(viz. S. Matth. xxviii. 2), which in every age has misled
Critics and Divines (as Origen and Eusebius); Poets (as
Rogers); Painters (as West);—yes, and will continue to mislead
readers for many a year to come:—and all because men
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page163">[pg 163]</span><a name="Pg163" id="Pg163" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
have failed to perceive that the aorist is used there for the
pluperfect. Translate,—<span class="tei tei-q">“There <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">had been</span></em> a great earthquake:”</span>
[and so (1611-1881) our margin,—until in short <span class="tei tei-q">“the Revisionists”</span>
interfered:] <span class="tei tei-q">“for the Angel of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span></span> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">had</span></em> descended

is it to thrust in there <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">I have believed</span></em>,”</span> as the English equivalent
for πεπίστευκα?—Just as intolerable is the officiousness

into English. Three such cases are found in S. Jo. xvi.
16, 17, 19. Surely, the future is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">inherent</span></em> in the present

To rejoin, as if it were a sufficient answer, that the definite
Article is found in all these places in the original Greek,—is
preposterous. In French also we say <span class="tei tei-q">“Telle est <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">la</span></em> vie:”</span>
but, in translating from the French, we do not <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">therefore</span></em> say
<span class="tei tei-q">“Such is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the</span></em> life.”</span> May we, without offence, suggest the
study of Middleton <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">On the Doctrine of the Greek Article</span></span> to
those members of the Revisionists' body who have favoured
us with the foregoing crop of mistaken renderings?

33. It is hard to see why.—These instances taken at random
must suffice. They might be multiplied to any extent. If

with regret that this is also a particular wherein we have been

of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">repeating the nominative</span></em> (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">e.g.</span></span> in Mk. i. 13: Jo. xx. 12) to

indeed when a fresh substantive statement is made: offended—at
their license of translation, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">when it suits them</span></em> to be licentious.—Thus,
(as the Bp. of S. Andrews has well pointed out,)
<span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">it is He that</span></em>”</span> is an incorrect translation of αὐτός in S. Matth.

Such an announcement, we submit, is calculated to
occasion nothing so much as uneasiness and astonishment.
Of all the parts of speech, the Greek Particles,—(especially
throughout the period when the Language was in its decadence,)—are
the least capable of being drilled into <span class="tei tei-q">“a general
uniformity of rendering;”</span> and he who tries the experiment
ought to be the first to be aware of the fact. The refinement
and delicacy which they impart to a narrative or a sentiment,
are not to be told. But then, from the very nature of
the case, <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">uniformity of rendering</span></em>”</span> is precisely the thing
they will not submit to. They take their colour from their
context: often mean two quite different things in the course
of two successive verses: sometimes are best rendered by a
long and formidable word;<a id="noteref_511" name="noteref_511" href="#note_511"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">511</span></span></a> sometimes cannot (without a

occasions, the freshness and freedom of almost every
passage has been made to disappear: the plain fact being
that the men of 1611—above all, that William Tyndale 77
years before them—produced a work of real genius; seizing
with generous warmth the meaning and intention of the
sacred Writers, and perpetually varying the phrase, as they
felt, or fancied that Evangelists and Apostles would have
varied it, had they had to express themselves in English:
whereas the men of 1881 have fulfilled their task in what
can only be described as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">a spirit of servile pedantry</span></em>. The
Grammarian (pure and simple) crops up everywhere. We
seem never to rise above the atmosphere of the lecture-room,—the

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We subjoin a single specimen of the countless changes
introduced in the rendering of Particles, and then hasten on.
In 1 Cor. xii. 20, for three centuries and a half, Englishmen
have been contented to read (with William Tyndale), <span class="tei tei-q">“But
now are they many members, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">yet but</span></span> one body.”</span> Our
Revisionists, (overcome by the knowledge that δέ means
<span class="tei tei-q">“but,”</span> and yielding to the supposed <span class="tei tei-q">“necessity for preserving
a general uniformity of rendering,”</span>) substitute,—<span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">But</span></em> now
they are many members, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">but</span></em> one body.”</span> Comment ought to
be superfluous. We neither overlook the fact that δέ occurs
here twice, nor deny that it is fairly represented by <span class="tei tei-q">“but”</span> in
the first instance. We assert nevertheless that, on the
second occasion, <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">yet but</span></span>”</span> ought to have been let alone.
And this is a fair sample of the changes which have been
effected <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">many times in every page</span></em>. To proceed however.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(2) The interrogative particle ἤ occurs at the beginning
of a sentence at least 8 or 10 times in the N. T.; first, in
S. Matth. vii. 9. It is often scarcely translateable,—being
apparently invested with with no more emphasis than belongs to
our colloquial interrogative <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Eh?</span></em>”</span> But sometimes it would
evidently bear to be represented by <span class="tei tei-q">“Pray,”</span><a id="noteref_538" name="noteref_538" href="#note_538"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">538</span></span></a>—being at least
equivalent to φέρε in Greek or <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">age</span></span> in Latin. Once only
(viz. in 1 Cor. xiv. 36) does this interrogative particle so
eloquently plead for recognition in the text, that both our
A. V. and the R. V. have rendered it <span class="tei tei-q">“What?”</span>—by which
word, by the way, it might very fairly have been represented
in S. Matth. xxvi. 53 and Rom. vi. 3: vii. 1. In five of the
places where the particle occurs. King James's Translators are
observed to have give it up in despair.<a id="noteref_539" name="noteref_539" href="#note_539"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">539</span></span></a> But what is to be
thought of the adventurous dulness which (with the single
exception already indicated) has <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">invariably</span></em> rendered ἤ by
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page169">[pg 169]</span><a name="Pg169" id="Pg169" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the conjunction <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">or</span></em>”</span>? The blunder is the more inexcusable,
because the intrusion of such an irrelevant conjunction into
places where it is without either use or meaning cannot have
failed to attract the notice of every member of the Revising
body.

(3) At the risk of being wearisome, we must add a few
words.—Καί, though no particle but a conjunction, may for

conformity with what may be called the genius
of the English language. The last six of these renderings,
however, our Revisionists disallow; everywhere thrusting
out the word which the argument seems rather to require,
and with mechanical precision thrusting into its place every
time the (perfectly safe, but often palpably inappropriate)
word, <span class="tei tei-q">“and.”</span> With what amount of benefit this has been
effected, one or two samples will sufficiently illustrate:—
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">a</span></span>) The Revisionists inform us that when <span class="tei tei-q">“the high priest

in effect our Translators of 1611. What possible improvement
on this can it be to substitute, <span class="tei tei-q">“For the sun ariseth ...

of the discourse; while in other two,—(namely, in
S. John xiv. 5 and 9,)—the text itself has been mercilessly
deprived of its characteristic καί by the Revisionists.—Let
this suffice. One might fill many quires of paper with such

VIII. <span class="tei tei-q">“Many changes”</span> (we are informed) <span class="tei tei-q">“have been introduced

statement, for (as was shown above [pp. <a href="#Pg155" class="tei tei-ref">155-6</a>]) the second
chapter of S. Matthew's Gospel exhibits the Revisionists
<span class="tei tei-q">“all a-field”</span> in respect of διά. <span class="tei tei-q">“We have rarely made any

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page171">[pg 171]</span><a name="Pg171" id="Pg171" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
would of course ill become such an one as the present
Reviewer to lay claim to the foregoing flattering designation:
but really, when he now for the first time reads (in Acts
ix. 25) that the disciples of Damascus let S. Paul down
<span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">through the wall</span></em>,”</span> he must be pardoned for regretting the
absence of a marginal reference to the history of Pyramus
and Thisbe in order to suggest <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">how</span></em> the operation was effected:
for, as it stands, the R. V. is to him simply unintelligible.
Inasmuch as the basket (σπυρίς) in which the Apostle
effected his escape was of considerable size, do but think
what an extravagantly large hole it must have been to enable
them <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">both</span></em> to get through!... But let us look further.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Was it then in order to bring Scripture within the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">captus</span></span>
of <span class="tei tei-q">“a Reader of ordinary intelligence”</span> that the Revisers have

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The foregoing strikes us as a singular illustration of
the Revisionists' statement (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Preface</span></span>, iii. 2),—<span class="tei tei-q">“We made <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">no</span></em>
change <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">if the meaning was fairly expressed</span></em> by the word or
phrase that was before us in the Authorized Version.”</span> To
ourselves it appears that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">every one of those 30 changes is a
change for the worse</span></em>; and that one of the most exquisite
passages in the N. T. has been hopelessly spoiled,—rendered
in fact well-nigh unintelligible,—by the pedantic officiousness
of the Revisers. Were they—(if the question be allowable)—bent
on removing none but <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">plain and clear errors</span></em>,”</span>
when they substituted those 30 words? Was it in token of
their stern resolve <span class="tei tei-q">“to introduce into the Text <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">as few alterations
as possible</span></em>,”</span> that they spared the eight words which
remain out of the eight-and-thirty?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As for their <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">wooden</span></em> rendering of ἐν, it ought to suffice
to refer them to S. Mk. i. 23, S. Lu. xiv. 31, to prove that sometimes
ἐν can only be rendered <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">with</span></em>”</span>:—and to S. Luke vii. 17,
to show them that ἐν sometimes means <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">throughout</span></em>”</span>:—and to
Col. i. 16, and Heb. i. 1, 2, in proof that sometimes it means
<span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">by</span></em>.”</span>—On the other hand, their suggestion that ἐν may be
rendered <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">by</span></em>”</span> in S. Luke i. 51, convicts them of not being
aware that <span class="tei tei-q">“the proud-in-the-imagination-of-their-hearts”</span> is
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">a phrase</span></em>—in which perforce <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">by</span></em>”</span> has no business whatever.
One is surprised to have to teach professed Critics and
Scholars an elementary fact like this.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In brief, these learned men are respectfully assured that
there is not one of the <span class="tei tei-q">“Parts of Speech”</span> which will consent
to be handled after the inhumane fashion which seems to be
to themselves congenial. Whatever they may think of the
matter, it is nothing else but absurd to speak of an Angel
<span class="tei tei-q">“casting his sickle <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">into the earth</span></em>”</span> (Rev. xiv. 19).—As for his
<span class="tei tei-q">“pouring out his bowl <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">upon the air</span></em>”</span> (xvi. 17),—we really
fail to understand the nature of the operation.—And pray,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page173">[pg 173]</span><a name="Pg173" id="Pg173" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
What is supposed to be the meaning of <span class="tei tei-q">“the things <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">upon
the heavens</span></em>”</span>—in Ephesians i. 10?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Returning to the preposition διά followed by the genitive,—(in
respect of which the Revisionists challenge Criticism by
complaining in their Preface [iii. 3 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ad fin.</span></span>] that in the A. V.
<span class="tei tei-q">“ideas of instrumentality or of mediate agency, distinctly
marked in the original, have been <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">confused or obscured in the
Translation</span></em>,”</span>)—we have to point out:—
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(1st) That these distinguished individuals seem not to be
aware that the proprieties of English speech forbid the use of
<span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">through</span></em>”</span> (as a substitute for <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">by</span></em>”</span>) in certain expressions
where instrumentality is concerned. Thus, <span class="tei tei-q">“the Son of man”</span>
was not betrayed <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">through</span></em>”</span> Judas, but <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">by</span></em>”</span> him (Matt. xxvi.
24: Luke xxii. 22).—Still less is it allowable to say that a
prophecy was <span class="tei tei-q">“spoken,”</span> nay <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">written</span></em>,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">through</span></em> the Prophet”</span>
(Matth. i. 22 and margin of ii. 5). <span class="tei tei-q">“Who spake <em class="tei tei-emph"><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">by</span></span><span style="font-style: italic"> the Prophets</span></em>,”</span>
is even an article of the Faith.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And (2ndly),—That these scholars have in consequence
adopted a see-saw method of rendering διά,—sometimes in
one way, sometimes in the other. First, they give us <span class="tei tei-q">“wonders
and signs done <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">by</span></em> the Apostles”</span> (Acts ii. 43; but in the
margin, <span class="tei tei-q">“Or, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">through</span></em>”</span>): presently, <span class="tei tei-q">“a notable miracle hath
been wrought <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">through</span></em> them”</span> (iv. 16: and this time, the
margin withholds the alternative, <span class="tei tei-q">“Or, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">by</span></em>”</span>). Is then <span class="tei tei-q">“the
true meaning”</span> of <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">by</span></em>,”</span> in the former place, <span class="tei tei-q">“apparent to a
Reader of ordinary intelligence”</span>? but so obscure in the latter
as to render <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">necessary</span></em> the alteration to <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">through</span></em>”</span>? Or (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">sit
venia verbo</span></span>),—Was it a mere <span class="tei tei-q">“toss-up”</span> with the Revisionists
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">what</span></em> is the proper rendering of διά?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(3rdly), In an earlier place (ii. 22), we read of <span class="tei tei-q">“miracles,
wonders, and signs”</span> which <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">God</span></span> did <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">by</span></em>”</span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Jesus</span></span> of Nazareth.
Was it reverence, which, on that occasion, forbad the use of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page174">[pg 174]</span><a name="Pg174" id="Pg174" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">through</span></em>”</span>—even in the margin? We hope so: but the preposition
is still the same—διά not ὑπό.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Lastly (4thly),—The doctrine that Creation is the work of
the Divine <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Word</span></span>, all Scripture attests. <span class="tei tei-q">“All things were
made <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">by</span></em> Him”</span> (S. Jo. i. 3):—<span class="tei tei-q">“the world was made <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">by</span></em> Him”</span>
(ver. 10).—Why then, in Col. i. 16, where the same statement
is repeated,—(<span class="tei tei-q">“all things were created <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">by</span></em> Him and for
Him,”</span>)—do we find <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">through</span></em>”</span> substituted for <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">by</span></em>”</span>? And why
is the same offence repeated in 1 Cor. vii. 6,—(where we
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ought</span></em> to read,—<span class="tei tei-q">“one <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">God</span></span>, the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Father</span></span>, of whom are all
things ... and one <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord Jesus Christ</span></span>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">by</span></em> whom are all
things”</span>)?—Why, especially, in Heb. i. 2, in place of <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">by</span></em>
whom also [viz. by <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">the Son</span></span>] He made the worlds,”</span> do we
find substituted <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">through</span></em> whom”</span>?... And why add to
this glaring inconsistency the wretched vacillation of giving
us the choice of <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">through</span></em>”</span> (in place of <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">by</span></em>”</span>) in the margin of
S. John i. 3 and 10, and not even offering us the alternative
of <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">by</span></em>”</span> (in place of <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">through</span></em>”</span>) in any of the other places,—although
the preposition is διά on every occasion?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And thus much for the Revisers' handling of the Prepositions.
We shall have said all that we can find room for,
when we have further directed attention to the uncritical
and unscholarlike Note with which they have disfigured the
margin of S. Mark i. 9. We are there informed that,
according to the Greek, our <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Saviour</span></span> <span class="tei tei-q">“was baptized <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">into the
Jordan</span></em>,”</span>—an unintelligible statement to English readers, as
well as a misleading one. Especially on their guard should
the Revisers have been hereabouts,—seeing that, in a place
of vital importance on the opposite side of the open page
(viz. in S. Matth. xxviii. 19), they had already substituted
<span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">into</span></em>”</span> for <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in</span></em>.”</span> This latter alteration, one of the Revisers
(Dr. Vance Smith) rejoices over, because it obliterates (in his
account) the evidence for Trinitarian doctrine. That the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page175">[pg 175]</span><a name="Pg175" id="Pg175" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Revisionists, as a body, intended nothing less,—<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">who</span></em> can
doubt? But then, if they really deemed it necessary to
append a note to S. Mark i. 9 in order to explain to the public
that the preposition εἰς signifies <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">into</span></em>”</span> rather than <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in</span></em>,”</span>—why
did they not at least go on to record the elementary
fact that εἰς has here (what grammarians call) a <span class="tei tei-q">“pregnant
signification”</span>? that it implies—(every schoolboy knows it!)—<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">and
that it is used in order to imply</span></em>—that the Holy One
<span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">went down</span></em> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">into</span></span>,”</span> and so, <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">was baptized</span></em> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">in</span></span> the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Jordan</span></em>”</span>?<a id="noteref_550" name="noteref_550" href="#note_550"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">550</span></span></a>...
But <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">why</span></em>, in the name of common sense, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">did not the Revisionists
let the Preposition alone</span></em>?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
IX. The <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Margin</span></span> of the Revision is the last point to which
our attention is invited, and in the following terms:—

They represent the results of </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">a large amount of careful and
elaborate discussion</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%">, and will, perhaps, by their very presence,
indicate to some extent the intricacy of many of the questions
that have almost daily come before us for decision. These
Notes fall into four main groups:—</span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">First</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%">, Notes specifying such
differences of reading as were judged to be of sufficient importance
to require a particular notice;—</span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">Secondly</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%">, Notes indicating
the exact rendering of words to which, for the sake of English
idiom, we were obliged to give a less exact rendering in the
text;—</span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">Thirdly</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%">, Notes, very few in number, affording some explanation
which the original appeared to require;—</span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">Fourthly</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%">,
Alternative Renderings in difficult or debateable passages. The
Notes of this last group are numerous, and largely in excess of
those which were admitted by our predecessors. In the 270
years that have passed away since their labours were concluded,
the Sacred Text has been minutely examined, discussed in every
detail, and analysed with a grammatical precision unknown in
the days of the last Revision. There has thus been accumulated

for different renderings, which necessarily came under discussion.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%">—(</span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">Preface</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%">,

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
When a body of distinguished Scholars bespeak attention
to a certain part of their work in such terms as these, it is
painful for a Critic to be obliged to declare that he has
surveyed this department of their undertaking with even less
satisfaction than any other. So long, however, as he assigns
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the grounds</span></em> of his dissatisfaction, the Reviewed cannot complain.
The Reviewer puts himself into their power. If he is
mistaken in his censure, his credit is gone. Let us take the
groups in order:—
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(1) Having already stated our objections against the many
Notes which specify <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Textual errors</span></em> which the Revisionists
declined to adopt,—we shall here furnish only two instances
of the mischief we deplore:—
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">a</span></span>) Against the words, <span class="tei tei-q">“And while they <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">abode</span></em> in Galilee”</span>
(S. Matthew xvii. 22), we find it stated,—<span class="tei tei-q">“Some ancient
authorities read <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">were gathering themselves together</span></em>.”</span> The plain
English of which queer piece of information is that א and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b</span></span>
exhibit in this place an impossible and untranslatable Reading,—the
substitution of which for ἀναστρεφομένων δὲ ἀυτῶν
can only have proceeded from some Western critic, who was
sufficiently unacquainted with the Greek language to suppose
that ΣΥΝ-στρεφομένων δὲ αὐτῶν, might possibly be the exact
equivalent for <em class="tei tei-emph"><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Con</span></span><span style="font-style: italic">-versantibus autem illis</span></em>. This is not the
place for discussing a kind of hallucination which prevailed
largely in the earliest age, especially in regions where Greek
was habitually read through Latin spectacles. (Thus it was,
obviously, that the preposterous substitution of <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Euraquilo</span></span>
for <span class="tei tei-q">“Euroclydon,”</span> in Acts xxvii. 14, took its rise.) Such
blunders would be laughable if encountered anywhere except
on holy ground. Apart, however, from the lamentable lack
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page177">[pg 177]</span><a name="Pg177" id="Pg177" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of critical judgment which a marginal note like the present

elicits <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">While they were gathering themselves together</span></em>”</span> out of
συστρεφομένων δὲ αὐτῶν? Are we to suppose that the clue
to the Revisers' rendering is to be found in (συστρέψαντος)
Acts xxviii. 3? We should be sorry to think it. They are
assured that the source of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Textual</span></em> blunder which they

all such renderings we will but say, that although
they are unquestionably better in the Margin than in the
Text; it also admits no manner of doubt that they would
have been best of all in neither. Were the Revisionists
serious when they suggested as the more <span class="tei tei-q">“exact”</span> rendering of
2 Pet. i. 20,—<span class="tei tei-q">“No prophecy of Scripture is of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">special</span></em> interpretation”</span>?
And what did they mean (1 Pet. ii. 2) by <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the
spiritual milk which is without guile</span></em>”</span>?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Not a few marginal glosses might have been dispensed
with. Thus, against διδάσκαλος, upwards of 50 times stands
the Annotation, <span class="tei tei-q">“Or, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">teacher</span></em>.”</span>—Ἄρτος, (another word of perpetual
recurrence,) is every time explained to mean <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">a loaf</span></em>.”</span>
But is this reasonable? seeing that φαγεῖν ἄρτον (Luke xiv. 1)
can mean nothing else but <span class="tei tei-q">“to eat <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">bread</span></em>”</span>: not to mention
the petition for <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">daily bread</span></em>”</span> in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord's</span></span> prayer. These
learned men, however, do not spare us even when mention is
made of <span class="tei tei-q">“taking the children's <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">bread</span></em> and casting it to the
dogs”</span> (Mk. vii. 27): while in the enquiry,—<span class="tei tei-q">“If a son shall
ask <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">bread</span></em> of any of you that is a father”</span> (Lu. xi. 11), <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">loaf</span></em>”</span> is
actually thrust into the text.—We cannot understand why
such marked favour has been shown to similar easy words.
Δοῦλος, occurring upwards of 100 times in the New Testament,
is invariably honoured (sometimes [as in Jo. xv. 15]
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">twice in the course of the same verse</span></em>) with 2 lines to itself, to
explain that in Greek it is <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">bondservant</span></em>.”</span>—About 60 times,
δαιμόνιον is explained in the margin to be <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">demon</span></em>”</span> in the
Greek.—It has been deemed necessary 15 times to devote
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">three lines</span></em> to explain the value of <span class="tei tei-q">“a penny.”</span>—Whenever
τέκνον is rendered <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Son</span></em>,”</span> we are molested with a marginal
annotation, to the effect that the Greek word means <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">child</span></em>.”</span>
Had the Revisionists been consistent, the margins would not
nearly have sufficed for the many interesting details of this
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page180">[pg 180]</span><a name="Pg180" id="Pg180" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
nature with which their knowledge of Greek would have
furnished them.

May we be allowed to suggest, that it would have been
better worth while to explain to the unlearned that ἀρχαι
in S. Peter's vision (Acts x. 11; xi. 5) in strictness means
not <span class="tei tei-q">“corners,”</span> but <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">beginnings</span></em>”</span> [cf. Gen. ii. 10]:—that τὴν
πρώτην (in Lu. xv. 22) is literally <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the first</span></em>”</span> [cf. Gen. iii. 7]
(not <span class="tei tei-q">“the best”</span>) <span class="tei tei-q">“robe”</span>:—that ἀληθινός (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">e.g.</span></span> in Lu. xvi. 11:
Jo. i. 9: vi. 32; and especially in xv. 1 and Heb. viii. 2 and
ix. 24) means <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">very</span></em>”</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">real</span></em>,”</span> rather than <span class="tei tei-q">“true”</span>?—And
when two different words are employed in Greek (as in S. Jo.
xxi. 15, 16, 17:—S. Mk. vii. 33, 35, &amp;c. &amp;c.), would it not
have been as well to try to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">represent</span></em> them in English? For
want of such assistance, no unlearned reader of S. Matth. iv.
18, 20, 21: S. Mk. i. 16, 18, 19: S. Lu. v. 2,—will ever be
able to understand the precise circumstances under which
the first four Apostles left their <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">nets</span></em>.”</span>

(3) The third group consists of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Explanatory Notes</span></em> required
by the obscurity of the original. Such must be the annotation
against S. Luke i. 15 (explanatory of <span class="tei tei-q">“strong drink”</span>),—<span class="tei tei-q">“Gr.
sikera.”</span> And yet, the word (σίκερα) happens to be <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">not</span></em>

annotation against μωρέ, in S. Matth. v. 22:—<span class="tei tei-q">“Or, <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Moreh</span></span>, a

incorrect. The word proves to be <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">not</span></em> Hebrew, but Greek.—And
this, against <span class="tei tei-q">“Maran atha”</span> in 1 Cor. xvi. 22,—<span class="tei tei-q">“That is,

<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the pods of the carob tree</span></em>,”</span>—which is really not true. The Greek
word is κεράτια,—which only signifies <span class="tei tei-q">“the pods of the carob

for calling the Kidron <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">a ravine</span></em>,”</span> you might as well call

Then further, <span class="tei tei-q">“Simon, the son of <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Jona</span></span>”</span> (in S. John i. 42
and xxi. 15), is for the first time introduced to our notice
by the Revisionists as <span class="tei tei-q">“the son of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">John</span></em>:”</span> with an officious
marginal annotation that in Greek the name is written
<span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Ioanes</span></span>.”</span> But is it fair in the Revisers (we modestly ask)
to thrust in this way the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">bêtises</span></span> of their favourite codex <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b</span></span>

<span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Jona</span></span>,”</span>—as appears from S. Matth. xvi. 17, and the present
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page182">[pg 182]</span><a name="Pg182" id="Pg182" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
two places in S. John's Gospel; where the evidence <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">against</span></em>
<span class="tei tei-q">“Ioannes”</span> is overwhelming. This is in fact the handy-work of
Dr. Hort. But surely the office of marginal notes ought to be
to assist, not to mislead plain readers: honestly, to state <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">facts</span></em>,—not,
by a side-wind, to commit the Church of England to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">a
new (and absurd) Textual theory</span></em>! The <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">actual Truth</span></em>, we insist,
should be stated in the margin, whenever unnecessary information
is gratuitously thrust upon unlearned and unsuspicious
readers.... Thus, we avow that we are offended at reading
(against S. John i. 18)—<span class="tei tei-q">“Many very ancient authorities read
<span class="tei tei-q">‘<em class="tei tei-emph"><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">God</span></span><span style="font-style: italic"> only begotten</span></em>’</span> ”</span>: whereas the <span class="tei tei-q">“authorities”</span> alluded to
read μονογενὴς Θεός,—(whether with or without the article
[ὁ] prefixed,)—which (as the Revisionists are perfectly well
aware) means <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the only-begotten </span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">God</span></span></em>,”</span> and no other thing.
Why then did they not say so? <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Because</span></em> (we answer)—<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">they
were ashamed of the expression</span></em>. But to proceed.—The information
is volunteered (against Matth. xxvi. 36 and Mk.
xiv. 32) that χωρίον means <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">an enclosed piece of ground</span></em>,”</span>—which
is not true. The statement seems to have proceeded
from the individual who translated ἄμφοδον (in Mk. xi. 4)
the <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">open street</span></em>:”</span> whereas the word merely denotes the <span class="tei tei-q">“highway,”</span>—literally

A very little real familiarity with the Septuagint would
have secured these Revisers against the perpetual exposure
which they make of themselves in their marginal Notes.—(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">a</span></span>)
Πάσας τὰς ἡμέρας, for instance, is quite an ordinary
expression for <span class="tei tei-q">“always,”</span> and therefore should not be exhibited
(in the margin of S. Matth. xxviii. 20) as a curiosity,—<span class="tei tei-q">“Gr.
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">all the days</span></em>.”</span>—So (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">b</span></span>) with respect to the word αἰών, which
seems to have greatly exercised the Revisionists. What need,
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">every time it occurs</span></em>, to explain that εἰς τοὺς αἰῶνας τῶν
αἰώνων means literally <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">unto the ages of the ages</span></em>”</span>? Surely
(as in Ps. xlv. 6, quoted Heb. i. 8,) the established rendering
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page183">[pg 183]</span><a name="Pg183" id="Pg183" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
(<span class="tei tei-q">“for ever and ever”</span>) is plain enough and needs no gloss!—Again,
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">c</span></span>) the numeral εἰς, representing the Hebrew substitute
for the indefinite article, prevails throughout the Septuagint.
Examples of its use occur in the N. T. in S. Matth. viii. 19
and ix. 18;-xxvi. 69 (μία παιδίσκη), Mk. xii. 42: and in
Rev. viii. 13: ix. 13: xviii. 21 and xix. 17;—where <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">one</span></em>
scribe,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">one</span></em> ruler,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">one</span></em> widow,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">one</span></em> eagle,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">one</span></em> voice,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">one</span></em>
angel,”</span> are really nothing else but mistranslations. True, that
εἶς is found in the original Greek: but what then? Because
<span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">une</span></span>”</span> means <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">one</span></em>,”</span> will it be pretended that <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="fr" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="fr"><span style="font-style: italic">Tu es une bête</span></span>”</span>
would be properly rendered <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Thou art one beast</span></em>”</span>?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">d</span></span>) Far more serious is the substitution of <span class="tei tei-q">“having <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">a great</span></em>
priest over the house of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">God</span></span>”</span> (Heb. x. 21), for <span class="tei tei-q">“having <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">an
high</span></em> priest:”</span> inasmuch as this obscures <span class="tei tei-q">“the pointed reference
to our <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span></span> as the antitype of the Jewish high priest,”</span>—who
(except in Lev. iv. 3) is designated, not ἀρχιερεύς, but either
ὁ ἱερεὺς ὁ μέγας, or else ὁ ἱερεύς only,—as in Acts v. 24<a id="noteref_561" name="noteref_561" href="#note_561"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">561</span></span></a>....
And (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">e</span></span>) why are we presented with <span class="tei tei-q">“For <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">no word from </span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">God</span></span><span style="font-style: italic">
shall be void of power</span></em>”</span> (in S. Luke i. 37)? Seeing that the
Greek of that place has been fashioned on the Septuagintal
rendering of Gen. xviii. 14 (<span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Is anything too hard for the
</span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span></span><span style="font-style: italic">?</span></em>”</span><a id="noteref_562" name="noteref_562" href="#note_562"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">562</span></span></a>), we venture to think that the A. V. (<span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">for with </span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">God</span></span><span style="font-style: italic">

It cannot be mended. One is surprised to discover that
among so many respectable Divines there seems not to have
been <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">one</span></em> sufficiently familiar with the Septuagint to preserve
his brethren from perpetually falling into such mistakes as
the foregoing. We really had no idea that the Hellenistic
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page184">[pg 184]</span><a name="Pg184" id="Pg184" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
scholarship of those who represented the Church and the
Sects in the Jerusalem Chamber, was so inconsiderable.

Two or three of the foregoing examples refer to matters of
a recondite nature. Not so the majority of the Annotations
which belong to this third group; which we have examined
with real astonishment—and in fact have remarked upon
already. Shall we be thought hard to please if we avow
that we rather desiderate <span class="tei tei-q">“Explanatory Notes”</span> on matters
which really <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">do</span></em> call for explanation? as, to be reminded of

is the true rendering of Lu. xix. 29 and xxi. 37: (or were the

to the Bp. of Lincoln's note on the place last quoted.)—Nay,
why not tell us (against Matth. i. 21) that <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Jesus</span></span>”</span>

must be derived (like πιστός [<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Prom.</span></span> V. v. 489]) from πίνω, and
would mean <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">drinkable</span></em>: but since ointment <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">cannot</span></em> be drunk,
it is certain that we must seek the etymology of the word
elsewhere. And why should the weak ancient conjecture
be retained that it is <span class="tei tei-q">“perhaps a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">local</span></em> name”</span>? Do Divines
require to have it explained to them that the one <span class="tei tei-q">“locality”</span>

word with lofty spiritual purpose. The <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">pure faith</span></em> (πίστις)
in which that offering of the ointment was made, determines
the choice of an unusual epithet (πιστικός) which shall

<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">moral</span></em> rather than a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">commercial</span></em> quality: just as, presently,
Mary's <span class="tei tei-q">“breaking”</span> the box (συντρίψασα) is designated by

<span class="tei tei-q">“Nahson,”</span> are in Greek <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Phares</span></span>,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Zara</span></span>,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Esrom</span></span>,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Naasson</span></span>.”</span>—But
(2), Through what <span class="tei tei-q">“necessity”</span> are the names, which we
have been hitherto contented to read as the Evangelist wrote
them, now exhibited on the first page of the Gospel in any
other way?<a id="noteref_568" name="noteref_568" href="#note_568"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">568</span></span></a>—(3) Assuming, however, the O. T. spelling

they would call him <span class="tei tei-q">“Jehoiachin,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Jeconiah,”</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">“Coniah.”</span>
[By the way,—Is it lawful to suppose that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">they did not know</span></em>
that <span class="tei tei-q">“Jechonias”</span> here represents two different persons?])—On
the other hand, (4) <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Amos</span></span>”</span> probably,—<span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Asaph</span></span>”</span> certainly,—are
corrupt exhibitions of <span class="tei tei-q">“Amon”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“Asa:”</span> and, if noticed
at all, should have been introduced to the reader's notice
with the customary formula, <span class="tei tei-q">“some ancient authorities,”</span> &amp;c.—To
proceed—(5), Why substitute <span class="tei tei-q">“Immanuel”</span> (for <span class="tei tei-q">“Emmanuel”</span>)
in ver. 23,—only to have to state in the margin that
S. Matthew writes it <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Emmanuel</span></span>”</span>? By strict parity of
reasoning, against <span class="tei tei-q">“Naphtali”</span> (in ch. iv. 13, 15), the Revisionists
ought to have written <span class="tei tei-q">“Gr. <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Nephthaleim</span></span>.”</span>—And
(6), If this is to be the rule, then why are we not told that
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page187">[pg 187]</span><a name="Pg187" id="Pg187" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<span class="tei tei-q">“Mary is in <span class="tei tei-q">‘Gr. <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Mariam</span></span>’</span> ”</span>? and why is not Zacharias
written <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Zachariah</span></span>”</span>?... But (to conclude),—What is the
object of all this officiousness? and (its unavoidable adjunct)
all this inconsistency? Has the spelling of the 42 names
been revolutionized, in order to sever with the Past and
to make <span class="tei tei-q">“a fresh departure”</span>? Or were the four marginal
notes added <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">only for the sake of obtaining, by a side-wind, the
(apparent) sanction of the Church</span></em> to the preposterous notion
that <span class="tei tei-q">“Asa”</span> was written <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Asaph</span></span>”</span> by the Evangelist—in conformity
with six MSS. of bad character, but in defiance of
History, documentary Evidence, and internal Probability?
Canon Cook [pp. 23-24] has some important remarks on
this.

X. We must needs advert again to the ominous admission
made in the Revisionists' <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Preface</span></span> (iii. 2 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">init.</span></span>), that to some
extent they recognized the duty of a <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">rigid adherence to the
rule of translating</span></em>, as far as possible, the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">same Greek word by
the same English word</span></em>.”</span> This mistaken principle of theirs lies
at the root of so much of the mischief which has befallen the
Authorized Version, that it calls for fuller consideration at our
hands than it has hitherto (viz. at pp. <a href="#Pg138" class="tei tei-ref">138</a> and <a href="#Pg152" class="tei tei-ref">152</a>) received.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The <span class="tei tei-q">“Translators”</span> of 1611, towards the close of their long
and quaint Address <span class="tei tei-q">“to the Reader,”</span> offer the following
statement concerning what had been their own practice:—<span class="tei tei-q">“We
have not <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">tied ourselves</span></em>”</span> (say they) <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">to an uniformity of
phrasing, or to an identity of words</span></em>, as some peradventure
would wish that we had done.”</span> On this, they presently
enlarge. We have been <span class="tei tei-q">“especially careful,”</span> have even
<span class="tei tei-q">“made a conscience,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“not to vary from the sense of that
which we had translated before, if the word signified the
same thing in both places.”</span> But then, (as they shrewdly
point out in passing,) <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">there be some words that be not of the
</span><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page188">[pg 188]</span><a name="Pg188" id="Pg188" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span style="font-style: italic">
same sense everywhere</span></em>.”</span> And had this been the sum of their
avowal, no one with a spark of Taste, or with the least
appreciation of what constitutes real Scholarship, would
have been found to differ from them. Nay, even when
they go on to explain that they have not thought it desirable
to insist on invariably expressing <span class="tei tei-q">“the same notion”</span> by employing
<span class="tei tei-q">“the same particular word;”</span>—(which they illustrate
by instancing terms which, in their account, may with
advantage be diversely rendered in different places;)—we
are still disposed to avow ourselves of their mind. <span class="tei tei-q">“If”</span> (say
they,) <span class="tei tei-q">“we translate the Hebrew or Greek word once <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">purpose</span></em>,
never to call it <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">intent</span></em>; if one where <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">journeying</span></em>, never <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">travelling</span></em>;
if one where <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">think</span></em>, never <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">suppose</span></em>; if one where <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">pain</span></em>,
never <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ache</span></em>; if one where <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">joy</span></em>, never <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">gladness</span></em>;—thus to mince
the matter, we thought to savour more of curiosity than
of wisdom.”</span> And yet it is plain that a different principle
is here indicated from that which went before. The remark
<span class="tei tei-q">“that niceness in words was always counted the next step to
trifling,”</span> suggests that, in the Translators' opinion, it matters
little <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">which</span></em> word, in the several pairs of words they instance,
is employed; and that, for their own parts, they rather
rejoice in the ease and freedom which an ample vocabulary
supplies to a Translator of Holy Scripture. Here also however,
as already hinted, we are disposed to go along with
them. Rhythm, subtle associations of thought, proprieties
of diction which are rather to be felt than analysed,—any of
such causes may reasonably determine a Translator to reject
<span class="tei tei-q">“purpose,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“journey,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“think,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“pain,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“joy,”</span>—in favour of
<span class="tei tei-q">“intent,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“travel,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“suppose,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“ache,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“gladness.”</span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But then it speedily becomes evident that, at the
bottom of all this, there existed in the minds of the
Revisionists of 1611 a profound (shall we not rather say
a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">prophetic</span></em>?) consciousness, that the fate of the English
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page189">[pg 189]</span><a name="Pg189" id="Pg189" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Hence</span></em> their reluctance to incur the responsibility of
tying themselves <span class="tei tei-q">“to an uniformity of phrasing, or to an

their plain avowal), <span class="tei tei-q">“if we should say, as it were, unto certain
words, Stand up higher, have a place in the Bible always;
and to others of like quality, Get you hence, be banished for
ever.”</span> But this, to say the least, is to introduce a distinct and
a somewhat novel consideration. We would not be thought
to deny that there is some—perhaps a great deal—of truth
in it: but by this time we seem to have entirely shifted our
ground. And we more than suspect that, if a jury of English
scholars of the highest mark could be impanelled to declare
their mind on the subject thus submitted to their judgment,
there would be practical unanimity among them in declaring,
that these learned men,—with whom all would avow hearty
sympathy, and whose taste and skill all would eagerly
acknowledge,—have occasionally pushed the license they
enunciate so vigorously, a little—perhaps a great deal—too
far. For ourselves, we are glad to be able to subscribe
cordially to the sentiment on this head expressed by the
author of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Preface</span></span> of 1881:

Yes, it cannot be doubted. When S. Paul, in a long and
familiar passage (2 Cor. i. 3-7), is observed studiously to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page190">[pg 190]</span><a name="Pg190" id="Pg190" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
linger over the same word (παράκλησις namely, which is
generally rendered <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">comfort</span></em>”</span>);—to harp upon it;—to reproduce
it <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ten times</span></em> in the course of those five verses;—it
seems unreasonable that a Translator, as if in defiance of the
Apostle, should on four occasions (viz. when the word comes
back for the 6th, 7th, 9th, and 10th times), for <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">comfort</span></em>”</span>
substitute <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">consolation</span></em>.”</span> And this one example may serve as
well as a hundred. It would really seem as if the Revisionists
of 1611 had considered it a graceful achievement to vary the
English phrase even on occasions where a marked identity of
expression characterizes the original Greek. When we find
them turning <span class="tei tei-q">“goodly apparel,”</span> (in S. James ii. 2,) into <span class="tei tei-q">“gay
clothing,”</span> (in ver. 3,)—we can but conjecture that they conceived
themselves at liberty to act exactly as S. James
himself would (possibly) have acted had he been writing
English.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But if the learned men who gave us our A. V. may
be thought to have erred on the side of excess, there can be
no doubt whatever, (at least among competent judges,) that
our Revisionists have sinned far more grievously and with
greater injury to the Deposit, by their slavish proclivity to
the opposite form of error. We must needs speak out
plainly: for the question before us is not, What defects are
discoverable in our Authorized Version?—but, What amount
of gain would be likely to accrue to the Church if the
present Revision were accepted as a substitute? And we
assert without hesitation, that the amount of certain loss
would so largely outweigh the amount of possible gain,
that the proposal may not be seriously entertained for a
moment. As well on grounds of Scholarship and Taste, as
of Textual Criticism (as explained at large in our former
Article), the work before us is immensely inferior. To
speak plainly, it is an utter failure.

XI. For the respected Authors of it practically deny the
truth of the principle enunciated by their predecessors of
1611, viz. that <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">there be some words that be not of the same
sense everywhere</span></em>.”</span> On such a fundamental truism we are
ashamed to enlarge: but it becomes necessary that we should
do so. We proceed to illustrate, by two familiar instances,—the
first which come to hand,—the mischievous result which
is inevitable to an enforced uniformity of rendering.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">a</span></span>) The verb αἰτεῖν confessedly means <span class="tei tei-q">“to ask.”</span> And
perhaps no better general English equivalent could be
suggested for it. But then, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in a certain context</span></em>, <span class="tei tei-q">“ask”</span> would
be an inadequate rendering: in another, it would be improper:
in a third, it would be simply intolerable. Of all
this, the great Scholars of 1611 showed themselves profoundly
conscious. Accordingly, when this same verb (in the middle
voice) is employed to describe how the clamorous rabble,
besieging Pilate, claimed their accustomed privilege, (viz. to
have the prisoner of their choice released unto them,) those
ancient men, with a fine instinct, retain Tyndale's rendering
<span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">desired</span></em>”</span><a id="noteref_569" name="noteref_569" href="#note_569"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">569</span></span></a> in S. Mark (xv. 8),—and his <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">required</span></em>”</span> in S. Luke
(xxiii. 23).—When, however, the humble entreaty, which
Joseph of Arimathea addressed to the same Pilate (viz. that
he might be allowed to take away the Body of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Jesus</span></span>), is in
question, then the same Scholars (following Tyndale and
Cranmer), with the same propriety exhibit <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">begged</span></em>.”</span>—King
David, inasmuch as he only <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">desired</span></em> to find a habitation for
the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">God</span></span> of Jacob,”</span> of course may not be said to have <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">asked</span></em>”</span>
to do so; and yet S. Stephen (Acts vii. 46) does not hesitate
to employ the verb ᾐτήσατο.—So again, when they of Tyre
and Sidon approached Herod whom they had offended: they
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page192">[pg 192]</span><a name="Pg192" id="Pg192" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
did but <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">desire</span></em>”</span> peace.<a id="noteref_570" name="noteref_570" href="#note_570"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">570</span></span></a>—S. Paul, in like manner, addressing
the Ephesians: <span class="tei tei-q">“I <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">desire</span></em> that ye faint not at my tribulations
for you.”</span><a id="noteref_571" name="noteref_571" href="#note_571"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">571</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But our Revisionists,—possessed with the single idea
that αἰτεῖν means <span class="tei tei-q">“to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ask</span></em>”</span> and αἰτεῖσθαι <span class="tei tei-q">“to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ask for</span></em>,”</span>—have
proceeded mechanically to inflict that rendering on every one
of the foregoing passages. In defiance of propriety,—of
reason,—even (in David's case) of historical truth,<a id="noteref_572" name="noteref_572" href="#note_572"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">572</span></span></a>—they
have thrust in <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">asked</span></em>”</span> everywhere. At last, however, they
are encountered by two places which absolutely refuse to
submit to such iron bondage. The terror-stricken jailer of
Philippi, when <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">he</span></em> <span class="tei tei-q">“asked”</span> for lights, must needs have done
so after a truly imperious fashion. Accordingly, the <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">called
for</span></em>”</span><a id="noteref_573" name="noteref_573" href="#note_573"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">573</span></span></a> of Tyndale and all subsequent translators, is <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">pro hâc
vice</span></span> allowed by our Revisionists to stand. And to conclude,—When
S. Paul, speaking of his supplications on behalf of
the Christians at Colosse, uses this same verb (αἰτούμενοι) in
a context where <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">to ask</span></em>”</span> would be intolerable, our Revisionists
render the word <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">to make request</span></em>;”</span><a id="noteref_574" name="noteref_574" href="#note_574"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">574</span></span></a>—though they might
just as well have let alone the rendering of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">all</span></em> their predecessors,—viz.
<span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">to desire</span></em>.”</span>

These are many words, but we know not how to make
them fewer. Let this one example, (only because it is the
first which presented itself,) stand for a thousand others.
Apart from the grievous lack of Taste (not to say of Scholarship)
which such a method betrays,—<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">who</span></em> sees not that the
only excuse which could have been invented for it has
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page193">[pg 193]</span><a name="Pg193" id="Pg193" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
disappeared by the time we reach the end of our investigation?
If αἰτέω, αἰτοῦμαι had been <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">invariably</span></em> translated <span class="tei tei-q">“ask,”</span>
<span class="tei tei-q">“ask for,”</span> it might at least have been pretended that <span class="tei tei-q">“the
English Reader is in this way put entirely on a level with the
Greek Scholar;”</span>—though it would have been a vain pretence,
as all must admit who understand the power of language.
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Once</span></em> make it apparent that just in a single place, perhaps in
two, the Translator found himself forced to break through
his rigid uniformity of rendering,—and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">what</span></em> remains but an
uneasy suspicion that then there must have been a strain
put on the Evangelists' meaning in a vast proportion of the
other seventy places where αἰτεῖν occurs? An unlearned
reader's confidence in his guide vanishes; and he finds that
he has had not a few deflections from the Authorized Version
thrust upon him, of which he reasonably questions alike the
taste and the necessity,—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">e.g.</span></span> at S. Matth. xx. 20.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">b</span></span>) But take a more interesting example. In S. Mark
i. 18, the A. V. has, <span class="tei tei-q">“and straightway they <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">forsook</span></em>”</span> (which
the Revisionists alter into <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">left</span></em>”</span>) <span class="tei tei-q">“their nets.”</span> Why?
Because in verse 20, the same word ἀφέντες will recur; and
because the Revisionists propose to let the statement (<span class="tei tei-q">“they
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">left</span></em> their father Zebedee”</span>) stand. They <span class="tei tei-q">“level up”</span> accordingly;
and plume themselves on their consistency.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We venture to point out, however, that the verb
ἀφιέναι is one of a large family of verbs which,—always
retaining their own essential signification,—yet depend for
their English rendering entirely on the context in which
they occur. Thus, ἀφιέναι is rightly rendered <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">to suffer</span></em>,”</span> in
S. Matth. iii. 15;—<span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">to leave</span></em>,”</span> in iv. 11;—<span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">to let have</span></em>,”</span> in v. 40;—<span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">to
forgive</span></em>,”</span> in vi. 12, 14, 15;—<span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">to let</span></em>,”</span> in vii. 4;—<span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">to yield
up</span></em>,”</span> in xxvii. 50;—<span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">to let go</span></em>,”</span> in S. Mark xi. 6;—<span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">to let alone</span></em>,”</span>
in xiv. 6. Here then, by the admission of the Revisionists,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page194">[pg 194]</span><a name="Pg194" id="Pg194" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
are eight diversities of meaning in the same word. But they
make the admission grudgingly; and, in order to render
ἀφιέναι as often as possible <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">leave</span></em>,”</span> they do violence to many
a place of Scripture where some other word would have been
more appropriate. Thus <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">laying aside</span></em>”</span> might have stood
in S. Mark vii. 8. <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Suffered</span></em>”</span> (or <span class="tei tei-q">“let”</span>) was preferable in
S. Luke xii. 39. And, (to return to the place from which we
started,) in S. Mark i. 18, <span class="tei tei-q">“forsook”</span> was better than <span class="tei tei-q">“left.”</span>
And why? Because men <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">leave</span></em> their father,”</span> (as the Collect
for S. James's Day bears witness); but <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">forsake</span></em> all covetous
desires”</span> (as the Collect for S. Matthew's Day aptly attests).
For which reason,—<span class="tei tei-q">“And they all <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">forsook</span></em> Him”</span> was infinitely
preferable to <span class="tei tei-q">“and they all <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">left</span></em> Him, and fled,”</span> in S. Mark
xiv. 50. We insist that a vast deal more is lost by this
perpetual disregard of the idiomatic proprieties of the English
language, than is gained by a pedantic striving after uniformity
of rendering, only because the Greek word happens to
be the same.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
For it is sure sometimes to happen that what seems
mere licentiousness proves on closer inspection to be unobtrusive
Scholarship of the best kind. An illustration presents
itself in connection with the word just now before us. It is
found to have been our <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Saviour's</span></span> practice to <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">send away</span></em>”</span>
the multitude whom He had been feeding or teaching, in
some formal manner,—whether with an act of solemn benediction,
or words of commendatory prayer, or both. Accordingly,
on the memorable occasion when, at the close of a
long day of superhuman exertion, His bodily powers succumbed,
and the Disciples were fain to take Him <span class="tei tei-q">“as He
was”</span> in the ship, and at once He <span class="tei tei-q">“fell asleep;”</span>—on that
solitary occasion, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the Disciples</span></em> are related to have <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sent away</span></em>
the multitudes,”</span>—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> to have formally dismissed them on
His behalf, as they had often seen their Master do. The
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page195">[pg 195]</span><a name="Pg195" id="Pg195" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
word employed to designate this practice on two memorable
occasions is ἀπολύειν:<a id="noteref_575" name="noteref_575" href="#note_575"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">575</span></span></a> on the other two, ἀφιέναι.<a id="noteref_576" name="noteref_576" href="#note_576"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">576</span></span></a> This
proves to have been perfectly well understood as well by the
learned authors of the Latin Version of the N. T., as by the
scholars who translated the Gospels into the vernacular of
Palestine. It has been reserved for the boasted learning of
the XIXth century to misunderstand this little circumstance
entirely. The R. V. renders S. Matth. xiii. 36,—not <span class="tei tei-q">“Then
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Jesus</span></span> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sent the multitude away</span></em>”</span> (<span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">dimissis turbis</span></span>”</span> in every
Latin copy,) but—<span class="tei tei-q">“Then He <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">left</span></em> the multitudes.”</span> Also
S. Mark iv. 36,—not <span class="tei tei-q">“And when they had <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sent away the
multitude</span></em>,”</span> (which the Latin always renders <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">et dimittentes
turbam</span></span>,”</span>) but—<span class="tei tei-q">“And <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">leaving</span></em> the multitude.”</span> Would it be
altogether creditable, we respectfully ask, if at the end of
1800 years the Church of England were to put forth with
authority such specimens of <span class="tei tei-q">“Revision”</span> as these?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">c</span></span>) We will trouble our Readers with yet another illustration
of the principle for which we are contending.—We
are soon made conscious that there has been a fidgetty
anxiety on the part of the Revisionists, everywhere to substitute
<span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">maid</span></em>”</span> for <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">damsel</span></em>”</span> as the rendering of παιδίσκη. It
offends us. <span class="tei tei-q">“A damsel named Rhoda,”</span><a id="noteref_577" name="noteref_577" href="#note_577"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">577</span></span></a>—and the <span class="tei tei-q">“damsel
possessed with a spirit of divination,”</span><a id="noteref_578" name="noteref_578" href="#note_578"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">578</span></span></a>—might (we think)
have been let alone. But out of curiosity we look further, to
see what these gentlemen will do when they come to S. Luke
xii. 45. Here, because παῖδας has been (properly) rendered
<span class="tei tei-q">“menservants,”</span> παιδίσκας, they (not unreasonably) render
<span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">maid-servants</span></em>,”</span>—whereby <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">they break their rule</span></em>. The crucial
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page196">[pg 196]</span><a name="Pg196" id="Pg196" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
place is behind. What will they do with the Divine
<span class="tei tei-q">“Allegory”</span> in Galatians, (iv. 21 to 31,)—where all turns on
the contrast<a id="noteref_579" name="noteref_579" href="#note_579"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">579</span></span></a> between the παιδίσκη and the ἐλευθέρα,—the
fact that Hagar was a <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">bondmaid</span></em>”</span> whereas Sarah was a <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">free
woman</span></em>”</span>? <span class="tei tei-q">“Maid”</span> clearly could not stand here. <span class="tei tei-q">“Maid-servant”</span>
would be intolerable. What is to be done? The
Revisionists adopt <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">a third</span></em> variety of reading,—<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">thus surrendering
their principle entirely</span></em>. And what reader with a
spark of taste, (we confidently ask the question,) does not
resent their substitution of <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">handmaid</span></em>”</span> for <span class="tei tei-q">“bondmaid”</span>
throughout these verses? <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Who</span></em> will deny that the mention
of <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">bondage</span></em>”</span> in verses 24 and 25 claims, at the hands of an
intelligent English translator, that he shall avail himself of
the admirable and helpful equivalent for παιδίσκη which, as
it happens, the English language possesses? More than
that. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Who</span></em>—(except one who is himself <span class="tei tei-q">“in bondage—with
his children”</span>)—<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">who</span></em> does not respond gratefully to the exquisite
taste and tact with which <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">bondmaid</span></em>”</span> itself has been
exchanged for <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">bondwoman</span></em>”</span> by our translators of 1611, in

their craft! <span class="tei tei-q">“There were giants in those days.”</span> As little
would they submit to be bound by the new cords of the
Philistines as by their green withes. Upon occasion, they
could shake themselves free from either. And why? For
the selfsame reason: viz. because the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Spirit</span></span> of their <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">God</span></span>

Let it not be supposed that we make light of the difficulties
which our Revisionists have had to encounter; or are
wanting in generous appreciation of the conscientious toil
of many men for many years; or that we overlook the perils
of the enterprise in which they have seen fit to adventure
their reputation. If ever a severe expression escapes us, it
is because our Revisionists themselves seem to have so very
imperfectly realized the responsibility of their undertaking,
and the peculiar difficulties by which it is unavoidably beset.
The truth is,—as all who have given real thought to the
subject must be aware,—the phenomena of Language are
among the most subtle and delicate imaginable: the problem
of Translation, one of the most manysided and difficult that
can be named. And if this holds universally, in how much
greater a degree when the book to be translated is <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">the Bible</span></span>!
Here, anything like a mechanical <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">levelling up</span></em> of terms, every
attempt to impose a pre-arranged system of uniform rendering
on words,—every one of which has a history and (so to
speak) <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">a will</span></em> of its own,—is inevitably destined to result in
discomfiture and disappointment. But what makes this so
very serious a matter is that, because <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Holy Scripture</span></span> is the
Book experimented upon, the loftiest interests that can be
named become imperilled; and it will constantly happen
that what is not perhaps in itself a very serious mistake may
yet inflict irreparable injury. We subjoin an humble illustration
of our meaning—the rather, because it will afford us
an opportunity for penetrating a little deeper into the proprieties
of Scriptural Translation:—

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">d</span></span>) The place of our <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord's</span></span> Burial, which is mentioned
upwards of 30 times in the Gospels, is styled in the original,
μνημεῖον. This appellation is applied to it three times by
S. Matthew;—six times by S. Mark;—eight times by
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page198">[pg 198]</span><a name="Pg198" id="Pg198" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
S. Luke;<a id="noteref_580" name="noteref_580" href="#note_580"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">580</span></span></a>—eleven times by S. John. Only on four occasions,
in close succession, does the first Evangelist call it by
another name, viz. τάφος.<a id="noteref_581" name="noteref_581" href="#note_581"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">581</span></span></a> King James's translators (following
Tyndale and Cranmer) decline to notice this diversity,
and uniformly style it the <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sepulchre</span></em>.”</span> So long as it belonged
to Joseph of Arimathea, they call it a <span class="tei tei-q">“tomb”</span> (Matth. xxvii.
60): when once it has been appropriated by <span class="tei tei-q">“the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span></span> of
Glory,”</span> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in the same verse</span></em> they give it a different English
appellation. But our Revisionists of 1881, as if bent on
<span class="tei tei-q">“making a fresh departure,”</span> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">everywhere</span></em> substitute <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">tomb</span></em>”</span> for
<span class="tei tei-q">“sepulchre”</span> as the rendering of μνημεῖον.

Does any one ask,—And why should they <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">not</span></em>? We
answer, Because, in connection with <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the Sepulchre</span></em>”</span> of our
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span></span>, there has grown up such an ample literature and such
a famous history, that we are no longer <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">able</span></em> to sever ourselves
from those environments of the problem, even if we desired
to do so. In all such cases as the present, we have to
balance the Loss against the Gain. Quite idle is it for the
pedant of 1881 to insist that τάφος and μνημεῖον are two
different words. We do not dispute the fact. (Then, if he
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">must</span></em>, let him represent τάφος in some other way.) It
remains true, notwithstanding, that the receptacle of our
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Saviour's</span></span> Body after His dissolution will have to be spoken
of as <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the Holy Sepulchre</span></em>”</span> till the end of time; and it is
altogether to be desired that its familiar designation should
be suffered to survive unmolested on the eternal page, in
consequence. There are, after all, mightier laws in the
Universe than those of grammar. In the quaint language of
our Translators of 1611: <span class="tei tei-q">“For is the Kingdom of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">God</span></span> become
words or syllables? Why should we be in bondage to them
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page199">[pg 199]</span><a name="Pg199" id="Pg199" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
if we may be free?”</span>... As for considerations of etymological
propriety, the nearest English equivalent for μνημεῖον
(be it remembered) is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">not</span></em> <span class="tei tei-q">“tomb,”</span> but <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">monument</span></em>.”</span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">e</span></span>) Our Revisionists seem not to be aware that 270 years
of undisturbed possession have given to certain words rights
to which they could not else have pretended, but of which
it is impossible any more to dispossess them. It savours of
folly as well as of pedantry even to make the attempt.
Διδαχή occurs 30,—διδασκαλία 21 times,—in the N. T.
Etymologically, both words alike mean <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">teaching</span></em>;”</span> and are

<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the </span><span class="tei tei-q">“doctrines”</span><span style="font-style: italic"> of Christianity</span></em>. When S. Paul speaks of <span class="tei tei-q">“the
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">doctrine</span></em> of baptisms”</span> (Heb. vi. 2), it is simply incomprehensible
to us why <span class="tei tei-q">“the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">teaching</span></em> of baptisms”</span> should be deemed
a preferable expression. And if the warning against being
<span class="tei tei-q">“carried about with every wind of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">doctrine</span></em>,”</span> may stand in
Ephes. iv. 14, why may it not be left standing in Heb. xiii. 9?

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">f</span></span>) In the same spirit, we can but wonder at the extravagant
bad taste which, at the end of 500 years, has ventured to
substitute <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">bowls</span></em>”</span> for <span class="tei tei-q">“vials”</span> in the Book of Revelation.<a id="noteref_587" name="noteref_587" href="#note_587"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">587</span></span></a> As a
matter of fact, we venture to point out that φιάλη no more
means <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">a bowl</span></em>”</span> than <span class="tei tei-q">“saucer”</span> means <span class="tei tei-q">“a cup.”</span> But, waiving
this, we are confident that our Revisers would have shown
more wisdom if they had <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">let alone</span></em> a word which, having no
English equivalent, has passed into the sacred vocabulary of
the language, and has acquired a conventional signification
which will cleave to it for ever. <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Vials of wrath</span></em>”</span> are understood
to signify the outpouring of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">God's</span></span> wrathful visitations
on mankind: whereas <span class="tei tei-q">“bowls”</span> really conveys no meaning at
all, except a mean and unworthy, not to say an inconveniently
ambiguous one. What must be the impression made
on persons of very humble station,—labouring-men,—when
they hear of <span class="tei tei-q">“the seven Angels that had <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the seven bowls</span></em>”</span>?
(Rev. xvii. 1.) The φιάλη,—if we must needs talk like
Antiquaries—is a circular, almost flat and very shallow
vessel,—of which the contents can be discharged in an
instant. It was used in pouring out libations. There is, at
that back of it, in the centre, a hollow for the first joint of
the forefinger to rest in. <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Patera</span></span> the Latins called it.
Specimens are to be seen in abundance.

The same Revisionists have also fallen foul of the
<span class="tei tei-q">“alabaster <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">box</span></em> of ointment.”</span>—for which they have substituted
<span class="tei tei-q">“an alabaster <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">cruse</span></em> of ointment.”</span><a id="noteref_588" name="noteref_588" href="#note_588"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">588</span></span></a> But what <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">is</span></em> a <span class="tei tei-q">“cruse”</span>?
Their marginal note says, <span class="tei tei-q">“Or, <span class="tei tei-q">‘<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">a flask</span></em>:’</span> ”</span> but once more,
what <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">is</span></em> <span class="tei tei-q">“a flask”</span>? Certainly, the receptacles to which that
name is now commonly applied, (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">e.g.</span></span> a powder-flask, a
Florence flask, a flask of wine, &amp;c.) bear no resemblance
whatever to the vase called ἀλάβαστρον. The probability is
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page201">[pg 201]</span><a name="Pg201" id="Pg201" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
that the receptacle for the precious ointment with which the
sister of Lazarus provided herself, was likest of all to a small
medicine-bottle (<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">lecythus</span></span> the ancients called it), made however
of alabaster. Specimens of it abound. But why not
let such words alone? The same Critics have had the good
sense to leave standing <span class="tei tei-q">“the bag,”</span> for what was confessedly
a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">box</span></em><a id="noteref_589" name="noteref_589" href="#note_589"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">589</span></span></a> (S.

We can but repeat that possession for <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">five centuries</span></em> conveys
rights which it is always useless, and sometimes dangerous,
to dispute. <span class="tei tei-q">“Vials”</span> will certainly have to be put back into
the Apocalypse.

greater importance.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And first for Ἀγάπη—a substantive noun unknown to
the heathen, even as the sentiment which the word expresses
proves to be a grace of purely Christian growth. What else
but a real calamity would be the sentence of perpetual
banishment passed by our Revisionists on <span class="tei tei-q">“that most excellent
gift, the gift of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Charity</span></em>,”</span> and the general substitution
of <span class="tei tei-q">“Love”</span> in its place? Do not these learned men perceive
that <span class="tei tei-q">“Love”</span> is not an equivalent term? Can they require
to be told that, because of S. Paul's exquisite and life-like
portrait of <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Charity</span></span>,”</span> and the use which has been made of
the word in sacred literature in consequence, it has come to
pass that the word <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Charity</span></em>”</span> connotes many ideas to which
the word <span class="tei tei-q">“Love”</span> is an entire stranger? that <span class="tei tei-q">“Love,”</span> on the
contrary, has come to connote many unworthy notions
which in <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Charity</span></em>”</span> find no place at all? And if this be
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page202">[pg 202]</span><a name="Pg202" id="Pg202" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
so, how can our Revisionists expect that we shall endure
the loss of the name of the very choicest of the Christian
graces,—and which, if it is nowhere to be found in Scripture,
will presently come to be only traditionally known among
mankind, and will in the end cease to be a term clearly
understood? Have the Revisionists of 1881 considered how
firmly this word <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Charity</span></em>”</span> has established itself in the
phraseology of the Church,—ancient, mediæval, modern,—as
well as in our Book of Common Prayer? how thoroughly
it has vindicated for itself the right of citizenship in the
English language? how it has entered into our common
vocabulary, and become one of the best understood of
<span class="tei tei-q">“household words”</span>? Of what can they have been thinking
when they deliberately obliterated from the thirteenth
chapter of S. Paul's 1st Epistle to the Corinthians the ninefold
recurrence of the name of <span class="tei tei-q">“that most excellent gift, the
gift of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Charity</span></span>”</span>?

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">h</span></span>) With equal displeasure, but with even sadder feelings,
we recognize in the present Revision a resolute
elimination of <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Miracles</span></span>”</span> from the N. T.—Not so, (we shall
be eagerly reminded,) but only of their <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Name</span></em>. True, but the
two perforce go together, as every thoughtful man knows.
At all events, the getting rid of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the Name</span></em>,—(except in the
few instances which are enumerated below,)—will in the
account of millions be regarded as the getting rid of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the
thing</span></em>. And in the esteem of all, learned and unlearned
alike, the systematic obliteration of the signifying word
from the pages of that Book to which we refer exclusively
for our knowledge of the remarkable thing signified,—cannot
but be looked upon as a memorable and momentous circumstance.
Some, it may be, will be chiefly struck by the
foolishness of the proceeding: for at the end of centuries
of familiarity with such a word, we are no longer <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">able</span></em> to
part company with it, even if we were inclined. The term
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page203">[pg 203]</span><a name="Pg203" id="Pg203" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
has struck root firmly in our Literature: has established
itself in the terminology of Divines: has grown into our
common speech. But further, even were it possible to get
rid of the words <span class="tei tei-q">“Miracle”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“Miraculous,”</span> what else but
abiding inconvenience would be the result? for we must
still desire to speak about <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the things</span></em>; and it is a truism to
remark that there are no other words in the language which
connote the same ideas. What therefore has been gained
by substituting <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sign</span></em>”</span> for <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">miracle</span></em>”</span> on some 19 or 20 occasions—(<span class="tei tei-q">“this
beginning of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">his signs</span></em> did <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Jesus</span></span>,”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“this is
again the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">second sign</span></em> that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Jesus</span></span> did”</span>)—we really fail to see.

to translate the Scriptures into English on etymological

resort to such a preposterous method was not instantly
scouted by a large majority of those who frequented the

We ask the question not caring for an answer. We are
merely bent on submitting to our Readers, whether,—especially
in an age like the present of wide-spread unbelief in
the Miraculous,—it was a judicious proceeding in our Revisionists
almost everywhere to substitute <span class="tei tei-q">“Sign”</span> for <span class="tei tei-q">“Miracle”</span>
as the rendering of σημεῖον.

certain school will be deemed uncharitable. If doctrinal
prepossession had no share in the production under review,—why

of the Revisionist body?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">j</span></span>) In a similar spirit to that which dictated our remarks
on the attempted elimination of <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Miracles</span></em>”</span> from the N. T. of
the future,—we altogether disapprove of the attempt to
introduce <span class="tei tei-q">“is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Epileptic</span></em>,”</span> as the rendering of σεληνιάζεται, in
S. Matth. xvii. 15. The miracle performed on <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the lunatic
child</span></em>”</span> may never more come abroad under a different name.
In a matter like this, 500 years of occupation, (or rather
1700, for <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">lunaticus</span></span>”</span> is the reading of all the Latin copies,)
constitute a title which may not be disputed. <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Epileptic</span></span>”</span>
is a sorry <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">gloss</span></em>—not a translation. Even were it demonstrable
that Epilepsy exclusively exhibits every feature related
in connection with the present case;<a id="noteref_596" name="noteref_596" href="#note_596"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">596</span></span></a> and that sufferers
from Epilepsy are specially affected by the moon's changes,
(neither of which things are <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">certainly</span></em> true): even so, the
Revisionists would be wholly unwarranted in doing violence
to the Evangelist's language, in order to bring into prominence
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page206">[pg 206]</span><a name="Pg206" id="Pg206" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
their own private opinion that what is called <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Lunacy</span></em>”</span>
here (and in ch. iv. 24) is to be identified with the ordinary
malady called <span class="tei tei-q">“Epilepsy.”</span> This was confessedly an extraordinary
case of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">demoniacal possession</span></em><a id="noteref_597" name="noteref_597" href="#note_597"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">597</span></span></a> besides. The Revisionists
have in fact gone out of their way in order to
introduce us to a set of difficulties with which before we
had no acquaintance. And after all, the English reader
desires to know—<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">not</span></em>, by any means, what two-thirds of the
Revisionists <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">conjecture</span></em> was the matter with the child, but—<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">what
the child's Father actually said</span></em> was the matter with him.
Now, the Father undeniably did <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">not</span></em> say that the child was
<span class="tei tei-q">“Epileptic,”</span> but that he was <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Lunatic</span></em>.”</span> The man employed a
term which (singular to relate) has its own precise English
equivalent;—a term which embodies to this hour (as it did
anciently) the popular belief that the moon influences certain
forms of disease. With the advance of Science, civilized
nations surrender such Beliefs; but they do not <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">therefore</span></em>
revolutionize their Terminology. <span class="tei tei-q">“The advance of Science,”</span>
however, has nothing whatever to do with <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the Translation of
the word</span></em> before us. The Author of this particular rendering
(begging his pardon) is open to a process <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">de lunatico inquirendo</span></span>”</span>
for having imagined the contrary.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">k</span></span>) The foregoing instances suggest the remark, that the
Ecclesiastical Historian of future years will point with concern
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page207">[pg 207]</span><a name="Pg207" id="Pg207" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
to the sad evidences that the Church had fallen on evil days
when the present Revision was undertaken. With fatal
fidelity does it, every here and there, reflect the sickly hues
of <span class="tei tei-q">“modern Thought,”</span> which is too often but another name
for the latest phase of Unfaithfulness. Thus, in view of
the present controversy about the Eternity of Future Punishment,
which has brought into prominence a supposed distinction
between the import of the epithets <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">eternal</span></span>”</span> and
<span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">everlasting</span></span>,”</span>—how painful is it to discover that the latter
epithet, (which is the one objected to by the unbelieving
school,) has been by our Revisionists diligently excluded<a id="noteref_598" name="noteref_598" href="#note_598"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">598</span></span></a>
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">every time it occurs</span></em> as the translation of αἰώνιος, in favour of
the more palatable epithel <span class="tei tei-q">“eternal”</span>! King James's Translators
showed themselves impartial to a fault. As if to mark
that, in their account, the words are of identical import, they
even introduced <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">both words into the same verse</span></em><a id="noteref_599" name="noteref_599" href="#note_599"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">599</span></span></a> of Scripture.
Is it fair that such a body of men as the Revisionists of
1881, claiming the sanction of the Convocation of the
Southern Province, should, in a matter like the present,
throw all their weight into the scale of Misbelief? They
were authorized only to remove <span class="tei tei-q">“plain and clear <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">errors</span></em>.”</span>
They were instructed to introduce <span class="tei tei-q">“as few changes <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">as possible</span></em>.”</span>
Why have they needlessly gone out of their way,
on the contrary, indirectly to show their sympathy with
those who deny what has been the Church's teaching for
1800 years? Our Creeds, Te Deum, Litany, Offices, Articles,—our
whole Prayer Book, breathes a different spirit and
speaks a different language.... Have our Revisionists persuaded
the Old Testament company to follow their example?
It will be calamitous if they <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">have</span></em>. There will be serious
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page208">[pg 208]</span><a name="Pg208" id="Pg208" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
discrepancy of teaching between the Old and the New
Testament if they have <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">not</span></em>.

(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">l</span></span>) What means also the fidgetty anxiety manifested
throughout these pages to explain away, or at least to
evacuate, expressions which have to do with <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Eternity</span></span>?
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Why</span></em>, for example, is <span class="tei tei-q">“the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">world</span></em> (αἰών) to come,”</span> invariably
glossed <span class="tei tei-q">“the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">age</span></em> to come”</span>? and εἰς τοὺς αἰῶνας so persistently
explained in the margin to mean, <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">unto the ages</span></em>”</span>? (See the
margin of Rom. ix. 5. Are we to read <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">God</span></span> blessed <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">unto the

of precisely similar character (viz. <span class="tei tei-q">“for ever,”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“for ever

as this!

(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">m</span></span>) Again. At a period of prevailing unbelief in the
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Inspiration</span></span> of Scripture, nothing but real necessity could
warrant any meddling with such a testimony on the subject
as is found in 2 Tim. iii. 16. We have hitherto been taught
to believe that <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">All Scripture is given by inspiration of</span></em> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">God</span></span>

S. Paul's words: and so do the most learned and thoughtful
of the moderns. Πᾶσα γραφή, even if it be interpreted
<span class="tei tei-q">“every Scripture,”</span> can only mean every portion of those
ἱερὰ γράμματα of which the Apostle had been speaking in
the previous verse; and therefore must needs signify <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the
whole of Scripture</span></em>.<a id="noteref_601" name="noteref_601" href="#note_601"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">601</span></span></a> So that the expression <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">all Scripture</span></em>”</span>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page209">[pg 209]</span><a name="Pg209" id="Pg209" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
expresses S. Paul's meaning exactly, and should not have
been disturbed.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But—<span class="tei tei-q">“It is very difficult”</span> (so at least thinks the Right
Rev. Chairman of the Revisers) <span class="tei tei-q">“to decide whether θεόπνευστος
is a part of the predicate, καί being the simple copula; or
whether it is a part of the subject. Lexicography and
grammar contribute but little to a decision.”</span> Not so
thought Bishop Middleton. <span class="tei tei-q">“I do not recollect”</span> (he says)
<span class="tei tei-q">“any passage in the N. T. in which two Adjectives, apparently
connected by the copulative, were intended by the writer to
be so unnaturally disjoined. He who can produce such an
instance, will do much towards establishing the plausibility
of a translation, which otherwise must appear, to say the
least of it, to be forced and improbable.”</span>—And yet it is
proposed to thrust this <span class="tei tei-q">“forced and improbable”</span> translation
on the acceptance of all English-speaking people, wherever
found, on the plea of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">necessity</span></em>! Our Revisionists translate,
<span class="tei tei-q">“Every Scripture inspired of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">God</span></span> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">is also profitable</span></em>,”</span> &amp;c.,—which
of course may be plausibly declared to imply that
a distinction is drawn by the Apostle himself between inspired
and uninspired Scripture. And pray, (we should be
presently asked,) is not many a Scripture (or writing) <span class="tei tei-q">“profitable
for teaching,”</span> &amp;c. which is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">not</span></em> commonly held to be <span class="tei tei-q">“inspired
of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">God</span></span>”</span>?... But in fact the proposed rendering is
inadmissible, being without logical coherence and consistency.
The utmost that could be pretended would be that S. Paul's
assertion is that <span class="tei tei-q">“every portion of Scripture <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">being inspired</span></em>”</span>
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> inasmuch as it is—because it is—inspired); <span class="tei tei-q">“is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">also</span></em>
profitable,”</span> &amp;c. Else there would be no meaning in the καί.
But, in the name of common sense, if this be so, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">why</span></em> have
the blessed words been meddled with?

Against such an overwhelming torrent of Patristic testimony,—for
we have enumerated <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">upwards of sixty</span></em> ancient
Fathers—it will not surely be pretended that the Socinian
interpretation, to which our Revisionists give such prominence,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page214">[pg 214]</span><a name="Pg214" id="Pg214" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
can stand. But why has it been introduced <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">at all</span></em>? We
shall have every Christian reader with us in our contention,
that such perverse imaginations of <span class="tei tei-q">“modern Interpreters”</span> are
not entitled to a place in the margin of the N. T. For our
Revisionists to have even given them currency, and thereby a
species of sanction, constitutes in our view a very grave offence.<a id="noteref_659" name="noteref_659" href="#note_659"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">659</span></span></a>
A public retraction and a very humble Apology we claim at

gloss gratuitously thrust into the margin of every Englishman's

<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">any</span></em> terms. It would by itself, in our account, have been
sufficient to determine the fate of the present Revision.

XII. Are we to regard it as a kind of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">set-off</span></em> against all
that goes before, that in an age when the personality of
Satan is freely called in question, <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">the evil one</span></span>”</span> has been
actually <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">thrust into the Lord's Prayer</span></em>? A more injudicious
and unwarrantable innovation it would be impossible to
indicate in any part of the present unhappy volume. The
case has been argued out with much learning and ability
by two eminent Divines, Bp. Lightfoot and Canon Cook.
The Canon remains master of the field. That <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the change
ought never to have been made</span></em> is demonstrable. The grounds
of this assertion are soon stated. To begin, (1) It is admitted
on all hands that it must for ever remain a matter of opinion
only whether in the expression ἀπὸ τοῦ πονηροῦ, the nominative
case is τὸ πονηρόν (as in S. Matth. v. 37, 39: Rom.
xii. 9), or ὁ πονηρός (as in S. Matth. xiii. 19, 38: Eph. vi.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page215">[pg 215]</span><a name="Pg215" id="Pg215" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
16),—either of which yields a good sense. But then—(2)
The Church of England in her formularies having emphatically
declared that, for her part, she adheres to the former
alternative, it was in a very high degree unbecoming for the
Revisionists to pretend to the enjoyment of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">certain</span></em> knowledge
that the Church of England in so doing was mistaken:
and unless <span class="tei tei-q">“from evil”</span> be <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">a clear and plain error</span></em>,”</span> the Revisionists
were bound to let it alone. Next—(3), It can
never be right to impose the narrower interpretation on
words which have always been understood to bear the larger
sense: especially when (as in the present instance) the
larger meaning distinctly includes and covers the lesser:
witness the paraphrase in our Church Catechism,—<span class="tei tei-q">“and that
He will keep us (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">a</span></span>) from all sin and wickedness, and (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">b</span></span>)
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">from our ghostly enemy</span></em>, and (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">c</span></span>) from everlasting death.”</span>—(4)
But indeed Catholic Tradition claims to be heard in this
behalf. Every Christian at his Baptism renounces not only
<span class="tei tei-q">“the Devil,”</span> but also <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">all his works</span></em>, the vain pomp and glory
of the world, with all covetous desires of the same, and the
carnal desires of the flesh.”</span><a id="noteref_660" name="noteref_660" href="#note_660"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">660</span></span></a> And at this point—(5), The
voice of an inspired Apostle interposes in attestation that
this is indeed the true acceptation of the last petition in the
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord's</span></span> Prayer: for when S. Paul says—<span class="tei tei-q">“the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span></span> will
deliver me <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">from every evil work</span></em> and will preserve me unto
His heavenly kingdom; to whom be glory for ever and ever.
Amen,”</span><a id="noteref_661" name="noteref_661" href="#note_661"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">661</span></span></a>—what else is he referring to but to the words just
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page216">[pg 216]</span><a name="Pg216" id="Pg216" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
now under consideration? He explains that in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord's</span></span>
Prayer it is <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">from every evil work</span></em>”</span> that we pray to be
<span class="tei tei-q">“delivered.”</span> (Note also, that he retains <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">the Doxology</span></span>.) Compare

Then further—(6), What more unlikely than that our
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span></span> would end with giving such prominence to that rebel
Angel whom by dying He is declared to have <span class="tei tei-q">“destroyed”</span>?
(Heb. ii. 14: 1 John iii. 8.) For, take away the Doxology
(as our Revisionists propose), and we shall begin the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord's</span></span>
Prayer with <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Our Father</span></span>,”</span> and literally end it with—<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the
Devil</span></em>!—But above all,—(7) Let it never be forgotten that
this is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the pattern Prayer</span></em>, a portion of every Christian
child's daily utterance,—the most sacred of all our formularies,
and by far the most often repeated,—into which it is
attempted in this way to introduce a startling novelty.
Lastly—(8), When it is called to mind that nothing short of
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">necessity</span></em> has warranted the Revisionists in introducing a
single change into the A. V.,—<span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">clear and plain errors</span></em>”</span>—and
that no such plea can be feigned on the present occasion, the
liberty which they have taken in this place must be admitted
to be absolutely without excuse.... Such at least are the
grounds on which, for our own part, we refuse to entertain
the proposed introduction of the Devil into the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord's</span></span>
Prayer. From the position we have taken up, it will be
found utterly impossible to dislodge us.

XIII. It is often urged on behalf of the Revisionists
that over not a few dark places of S. Paul's Epistles their
labours have thrown important light. Let it not be supposed
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page217">[pg 217]</span><a name="Pg217" id="Pg217" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
that we deny this. Many a Scriptural difficulty vanishes
the instant a place is accurately translated: a far greater
number, when the rendering is idiomatic. It would be
strange indeed if, at the end of ten years, the combined
labours of upwards of twenty Scholars, whose <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">raison d'être</span></span> as
Revisionists was to do this very thing, had not resulted in
the removal of many an obscurity in the A. V. of Gospels
and Epistles alike. What offends us is the discovery that,
for every obscurity which has been removed, at least half a
dozen others have been introduced: in other words, that the
result of this Revision has been the planting in of a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">fresh
crop of difficulties</span></em>, before undreamed of; so that a perpetual
wrestling with <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">these</span></em> is what hereafter awaits the diligent
student of the New Testament.

is from above, coming down from the Father of lights, with
whom <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">can be no variation</span></em>, neither <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">shadow that is cast by
turning</span></em>. Of his own will <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">he brought us forth</span></em>.”</span> Grievous as
such blemishes are, it is seen at a glance that they must be
set down to nothing worse than tasteless assiduity. What we
complain of is that, misled by a depraved Text, our Revisers
have often made nonsense of what before was perfectly clear:
and have not only thrust many of our <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord's</span></span> precious utterances
out of sight, (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">e.g.</span></span> Matt. xvii. 21: Mark x. 21 and xi. 26:
Luke ix. 55, 56); but have attributed to Him absurd sayings
which He certainly never uttered, (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">e.g.</span></span> Matt. xix. 17); or else,
given such a twist to what He actually said, that His
blessed words are no longer recognizable, (as in S. Matt. xi. 23:
S. Mark ix. 23: xi. 3). Take a sample:—
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">

(2.) We shall be told that the foregoing is an outrageous
instance. It is. Then take a few milder cases. They abound,
turn whichever way we will. Thus, we are invited to believe
that S. Luke relates concerning our <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Saviour</span></span> that He <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">was

What then has happened to obscure so plain a statement?
Nothing more serious than that—(1) Four copies of bad
character (א <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b d l</span></span>) exhibit <span class="tei tei-q">“in”</span> instead of <span class="tei tei-q">“into:”</span> and that—(2)
Our Revisionists have been persuaded to believe that
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">therefore</span></em> S. Luke must needs have done the same. Accordingly
they invite us to share their conviction that it was the
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">leading about</span></em> of our <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span></span>, (and not His <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Temptation</span></em>,) which
lasted for 40 days. And this sorry misconception is to be
thrust upon the 90 millions of English-speaking Christians
throughout the world,—under the plea of <span class="tei tei-q">“necessity”</span>!...

consequences which would ensue from the acceptance

(4.) Now this is the method of the Revising body throughout:
viz. so seriously to maim the Text of many a familiar
passage of Holy Writ as effectually to mar it. Even where
they remedy an inaccuracy in the rendering of the A. V.,
they often inflict a more grievous injury than mistranslation
on the inspired Text. An instance occurs at S. John x. 14,
where the good Shepherd says,—<span class="tei tei-q">“I know Mine own <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">and am
known of Mine</span></em>, even as the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Father</span></span> knoweth Me and I know
the Father.”</span> By thrusting in here the Manichæan depravation
(<span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">and Mine own know Me</span></em>”</span>), our Revisionists have
obliterated the exquisite diversity of expression in the
original,—which implies that whereas the knowledge which
subsists between the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Father</span></span> and the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Son</span></span> is identical on
either side, not such is the knowledge which subsists between
the creature and the Creator. The refinement in question
has been faithfully retained all down the ages by every copy
in existence except four of bad character,—א <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b d l</span></span>. It is
witnessed to by the Syriac,—by Macarius,<a id="noteref_691" name="noteref_691" href="#note_691"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">691</span></span></a>—Gregory Naz.,<a id="noteref_692" name="noteref_692" href="#note_692"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">692</span></span></a>—Chrysostom,<a id="noteref_693" name="noteref_693" href="#note_693"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">693</span></span></a>—Cyril

out of 1000, at the end of 1800 years, would be found

Now, in view of the phenomenon just discovered to us,—(viz.
for one crop of deformities weeded out, an infinitely
larger crop of far grosser deformities as industriously
planted in,)—we confess to a feeling of distress and annoyance
which altogether indisposes us to accord to the
Revisionists that language of congratulation with which it
would have been so agreeable to receive their well-meant
endeavours. The serious question at once arises,—Is it to
be thought that upon the whole we are gainers, or losers, by
the Revised Version? And there seems to be no certain
way of resolving this doubt, but by opening a <span class="tei tei-q">“Profit and
Loss account”</span> with the Revisers,—crediting them with every
item of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">gain</span></em>, and debiting them with every item of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">loss</span></em>.
But then,—(and we ask the question with sanguine simplicity,)—Why
should it not be <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">all</span></em> gain and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">no</span></em> loss, when,
at the end of 270 years, a confessedly noble work, a truly
unique specimen of genius, taste and learning, is submitted
to a body of Scholars, equipped with every external advantage,
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">only</span></em> in order that they may improve upon it—<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">if they
are able</span></em>? These learned individuals have had upwards of
ten years wherein to do their work. They have enjoyed the
benefit of the tentative labours of a host of predecessors,—some
for their warning, some for their help and guidance.
They have all along had before their eyes the solemn injunction
that, whatever they were not able <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">certainly</span></em> to
improve, they were to be <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">supremely careful to let alone</span></em>.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page222">[pg 222]</span><a name="Pg222" id="Pg222" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
They were warned at the outset against any but <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">necessary</span></em>”</span>
changes. Their sole business was to remove <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">plain and clear
errors</span></em>.”</span> They had pledged themselves to introduce <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">as few
alterations as possible</span></em>.”</span> Why then, we again ask,—<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Why</span></em>
should not every single innovation which they introduced
into the grand old exemplar before them, prove to be a
manifest, an undeniable change for the better?<a id="noteref_697" name="noteref_697" href="#note_697"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">697</span></span></a>

XIV. The more we ponder over this unfortunate production,
the more cordially do we regret that it was ever
undertaken. Verily, the Northern Convocation displayed a
far-sighted wisdom when it pronounced against the project
from the first. We are constrained to declare that could we
have conceived it possible that the persons originally appointed
by the Southern Province would have co-opted into
their body persons capable of executing their work with
such extravagant licentiousness as well as such conspicuous
bad taste, we should never have entertained one hopeful
thought on the subject. For indeed every characteristic
feature of the work of the Revisionists offends us,—as well

we also hold to be a great mistake. In the Greek, by all

far the most serious of all is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">that</span></em> Error to the consideration
of which we devoted our former Article. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">The New

Revisionists have constructed, has been proved to be utterly
undeserving of confidence. Built up on a fallacy which since
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page225">[pg 225]</span><a name="Pg225" id="Pg225" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
1831 has been dominant in Germany, and which has lately
found but too much favour among ourselves, it is in the
main a reproduction of the recent labours of Doctors Westcott
and Hort. But we have already recorded our conviction,
that the results at which those eminent Scholars have arrived
are wholly inadmissible. It follows that, in our account, the
<span class="tei tei-q">“New English Version,”</span> has been all along a foredoomed thing.
If the <span class="tei tei-q">“New Greek Text”</span> be indeed a tissue of fabricated
Readings, the translation of these into English must needs
prove lost labour. It is superfluous to enquire into the
merits of the English rendering of words which Evangelists
and Apostles demonstrably never wrote.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">h</span></span>) Even this, however, is not nearly all. As Translators,
full two-thirds of the Revisionists have shown themselves
singularly deficient,—alike in their critical acquaintance
with the language out of which they had to translate, and
in their familiarity with the idiomatic requirements of their
own tongue. They had a noble Version before them, which
they have contrived to spoil in every part. Its dignified
simplicity and essential faithfulness, its manly grace and
its delightful rhythm, they have shown themselves alike
unable to imitate and unwilling to retain. Their queer
uncouth phraseology and their jerky sentences:—their
pedantic obscurity and their stiff, constrained manner:—their
fidgetty affectation of accuracy,—and their habitual
achievement of English which fails to exhibit the spirit of
the original Greek;—are sorry substitutes for the living
freshness, and elastic freedom, and habitual fidelity of the
grand old Version which we inherited from our Fathers, and
which has sustained the spiritual life of the Church of
England, and of all English-speaking Christians, for 350
years. Linked with all our holiest, happiest memories, and
bound up with all our purest aspirations: part and parcel of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page226">[pg 226]</span><a name="Pg226" id="Pg226" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
whatever there is of good about us: fraught with men's hopes
of a blessed Eternity and many a bright vision of the never-ending
Life;—the Authorized Version, wherever it was possible,
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">should have been jealously retained</span></em>. But on the contrary.
Every familiar cadence has been dislocated: the congenial
flow of almost every verse of Scripture has been hopelessly
marred: so many of those little connecting words, which
give life and continuity to a narrative, have been vexatiously
displaced, that a perpetual sense of annoyance is created.
The countless minute alterations which have been needlessly
introduced into every familiar page prove at last as tormenting
as a swarm of flies to the weary traveller on a
summer's day.<a id="noteref_699" name="noteref_699" href="#note_699"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">699</span></span></a> To speak plainly, the book has been made

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But in fact the distinguished Chairman of the New Testament
Company (Bishop Ellicott,) has delivered himself on
this subject in language which leaves nothing to be desired,
and which we willingly make our own. <span class="tei tei-q">“No Revision”</span>
(he says) <span class="tei tei-q">“in the present day <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">could hope to meet with an

by a few weeds scattered here and there, the whole field
proves to be sown over in every direction with thorns and
briars; above all when, deep beneath the surface, roots of
bitterness to be counted by thousands, are found to have
been silently planted in, which are sure to produce poisonous
fruit after many days:—under <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">such</span></em> circumstances only one

up,—ploughed deep; and let the ground be left for a decent

idle—to dream of revising, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">with a view to retaining</span></em>, this
Revision. Another generation of students must be suffered
to arise. Time must be given for Passion and Prejudice
to cool effectually down. Partizanship, (which at present
prevails to an extraordinary extent, but which is wondrously
out of place in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">this</span></em> department of Sacred Learning,)—<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Partizanship</span></em>
must be completely outlived,—before the

Yes, and in the meantime—(let it in all faithfulness be

cannot be too soon or too unconditionally abandoned. And,
perhaps beyond all things, men must be invited to disabuse
their minds of the singular imagination that it is in their

On a review of all that has happened, from first to last,
we can but feel greatly concerned: greatly surprised: most of
all, disappointed. We had expected a vastly different result.
It is partly (not quite) accounted for, by the rare attendance
in the Jerusalem Chamber of some of the names on which
we had chiefly relied. Bishop Moberly (of Salisbury) was
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page229">[pg 229]</span><a name="Pg229" id="Pg229" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
present on only 121 occasions: Bishop Wordsworth (of S.
Andrews) on only 109: Archbishop Trench (of Dublin) on only
63: Bishop Wilberforce on only <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">one</span></em>. The Archbishop, in his
Charge, adverts to <span class="tei tei-q">“the not unfrequent sacrifice of grace and
ease to the rigorous requirements of a literal accuracy;”</span> and
regards them <span class="tei tei-q">“as pushed to a faulty excess”</span> (p. 22). Eleven
years before the scheme for the present <span class="tei tei-q">“Revision”</span> had been
matured, the same distinguished and judicious Prelate, (then
Dean of Westminster,) persuaded as he was that a Revision
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ought</span></em> to come, and convinced that in time it <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">would</span></em> come,
deprecated its being attempted <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">yet</span></em>. His words were,—<span class="tei tei-q">“Not
however, I would trust, as yet: for we are not as yet <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in any
respect prepared for it. The Greek, and the English</span></em> which
should enable us to bring this to a successful end might, it is
to be feared, be wanting alike.”</span><a id="noteref_704" name="noteref_704" href="#note_704"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">704</span></span></a> Archbishop Trench, with
wise after-thought, in a second edition, explained himself
to mean <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">that special Hellenistic Greek, here required</span></em>.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Bp. of S. Andrews has long since, in the fullest manner,
cleared himself from the suspicion of complicity in the errors
of the work before us,—as well in respect of the <span class="tei tei-q">“New Greek
Text”</span> as of the <span class="tei tei-q">“New English Version.”</span> In the Charge
which he delivered at his Diocesan Synod, (22nd Sept.
1880,) he openly stated that two years before the work was
finally completed, he had felt obliged to address a printed
circular to each member of the Company, in which he
strongly remonstrated against the excess to which changes
had been carried; and that the remonstrance had been, for
the most part, unheeded. Had this been otherwise, there
is good reason to believe that the reception which the
Revision has met with would have been far less unfavourable,
and that many a controversy which it has stirred up,
would have been avoided. We have been assured that the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page230">[pg 230]</span><a name="Pg230" id="Pg230" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Bp. of S. Andrews would have actually resigned his place in
the Company at that time, if he had not been led to expect
that some opportunity would have been taken by the
Minority, when the work was finished, to express their
formal dissent from the course which had been followed,
and many of the conclusions which had been adopted.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Were certain other excellent personages, (Scholars and
Divines of the best type) who were often present, disposed
at this late hour to come forward, they too would doubtless
tell us that they heartily regretted what was done, but were
powerless to prevent it. It is no secret that Dr. Lee,—the
learned Archdeacon of Dublin,—(one of the few really
competent members of the Revising body,)—found himself
perpetually in the minority.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The same is to be recorded concerning Dr. Roberts, whose
work on the Gospels (published in 1864) shows that he is
not by any means so entirely a novice in the mysteries of
Textual Criticism as certain of his colleagues.—One famous
Scholar and excellent Divine,—a Dean whom we forbear to
name,—with the modesty of real learning, often withheld
what (had he given it) would have been an adverse vote.—Another
learned and accomplished Dean (Dr. Merivale), after
attending 19 meetings of the Revising body, withdrew in
disgust from them entirely. He disapproved <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the method</span></em> of
his colleagues, and was determined to incur no share of responsibility
for the probable result of their deliberations.—By
the way,—What about a certain solemn Protest, by
means of which the Minority had resolved <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">liberare animas
suas</span></span> concerning the open disregard shown by the Majority
for the conditions under which they had been entrusted with
the work of Revision, but which was withheld at the last
moment? Inasmuch as their reasons for the course they
eventually adopted seemed sufficient to those high-minded and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page231">[pg 231]</span><a name="Pg231" id="Pg231" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
honourable men, we forbear to challenge it. Nothing however
shall deter us from plainly avowing our own opinion that
human regards scarcely deserve a hearing when <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">God's</span></span>
Truth is imperilled. And that the Truth of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">God's</span></span> Word in
countless instances <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">has been</span></em> ignorantly sacrificed by a majority
of the Revisionists—(out of deference to a worthless
Theory, newly invented and passionately advocated by two
of their body),—has been already demonstrated; as far, that
is, as demonstration is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">possible</span></em> in this subject matter.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As for Prebendary Scrivener,—<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the only really competent
Textual Critic of the whole party</span></em>,—it is well known
that he found himself perpetually outvoted by two-thirds
of those present. We look forward to the forthcoming
new edition of his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Plain Introduction</span></span>, in the confident
belief that he will there make it abundantly plain that he is
in no degree responsible for the monstrous Text which it
became his painful duty to conduct through the Press on
behalf of the entire body, of which he continued to the
last to be a member. It is no secret that, throughout, Dr.
Scrivener pleaded in vain for the general view we have
ourselves advocated in this and the preceding Article.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
All alike may at least enjoy the real satisfaction of
knowing that, besides having stimulated, to an extraordinary
extent, public attention to the contents of the Book
of Life, they have been instrumental in awakening a living
interest in one important but neglected department of
Sacred Science, which will not easily be again put to sleep.
It may reasonably prove a solace to them to reflect that
they have besides, although perhaps in ways they did not
anticipate, rendered excellent service to mankind. A monument
they have certainly erected to themselves,—though
neither of their Taste nor yet of their Learning. Their well-meant
endeavours have provided an admirable text-book for
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page232">[pg 232]</span><a name="Pg232" id="Pg232" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Teachers of Divinity,—who will henceforth instruct their
pupils to beware of the Textual errors of the Revisionists of
1881, as well as of their tasteless, injudicious, and unsatisfactory
essays in Translation. This work of theirs will discharge
the office of a warning beacon to as many as shall
hereafter embark on the same perilous enterprise with themselves.
It will convince men of the danger of pursuing the
same ill-omened course: trusting to the same unskilful
guidance: venturing too near the same wreck-strewn shore.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Its effect will be to open men's eyes, as nothing else
could possibly have done, to the dangers which beset the
Revision of Scripture. It will teach faithful hearts to cling
the closer to the priceless treasure which was bequeathed
to them by the piety and wisdom of their fathers. It will
dispel for ever the dream of those who have secretly imagined
that a more exact Version, undertaken with the
boasted helps of this nineteenth century of ours, would
bring to light something which has been hitherto unfairly
kept concealed or else misrepresented. Not the least
service which the Revisionists have rendered has been
the proof their work affords, how very seldom our
Authorized Version is materially wrong: how faithful and
trustworthy, on the contrary, it is throughout. Let it be
also candidly admitted that, even where (in our judgment)
the Revisionists have erred, they have never had the misfortune
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">seriously</span></em> to obscure a single feature of Divine Truth;
nor have they in any quarter (as we hope) inflicted wounds
which will be attended with worse results than to leave a
hideous scar behind them. It is but fair to add that their
work bears marks of an amount of conscientious (though
misdirected) labour, which those only can fully appreciate
who have made the same province of study to some extent
their own.

Proposing to ourselves (May 17th, 1881) to enquire into
the merits of the recent Revision of the Authorized Version
of the New Testament Scriptures, we speedily became aware
that an entirely different problem awaited us and demanded
preliminary investigation. We made the distressing discovery,
that the underlying Greek Text had been completely refashioned
throughout. It was accordingly not so much a
<span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Revised English Version</span></em>”</span> as a <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">New Greek Text</span></em>,”</span> which was
challenging public acceptance. Premature therefore,—not to
say preposterous,—would have been any enquiry into the
degree of ability with which the original Greek had been
rendered into English by our Revisionists, until we had first
satisfied ourselves that it was still <span class="tei tei-q">“the original Greek”</span> with
which we had to deal: or whether it had been the supreme
infelicity of a body of Scholars claiming to act by the
authority of the sacred Synod of Canterbury, to put themselves
into the hands of some ingenious theory-monger, and
to become the dupes of any of the strange delusions which
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page236">[pg 236]</span><a name="Pg236" id="Pg236" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
are found unhappily still to prevail in certain quarters, on
the subject of Textual Criticism.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The correction of known Textual errors of course we
eagerly expected: and on every occasion when the Traditional
Text was altered, we as confidently depended on
finding a record of the circumstance inserted with religious
fidelity into the margin,—as agreed upon by the Revisionists
at the outset. In both of these expectations however we
found ourselves sadly disappointed. The Revisionists have
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">not</span></em> corrected the <span class="tei tei-q">“known Textual errors.”</span> On the other
hand, besides silently adopting most of those wretched fabrications
which are just now in favour with the German school,
they have encumbered their margin with those other Readings
which, after due examination, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">they had themselves deliberately
rejected</span></em>. For why? Because, in their collective judgment,
<span class="tei tei-q">“for the present, it would not be safe to accept one Reading
to the absolute exclusion of others.”</span><a id="noteref_705" name="noteref_705" href="#note_705"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">705</span></span></a> A fatal admission
truly! What are found in the margin are therefore <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">alternative
Readings</span></em>,”</span>—in the opinion of these self-constituted
representatives of the Church and of the Sects.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It becomes evident that, by this ill-advised proceeding,
our Revisionists would convert every Englishman's copy
of the New Testament into a one-sided Introduction to
the Critical difficulties of the Greek Text; a labyrinth,
out of which they have not been at the pains to supply
him with a single hint as to how he may find his way.
On the contrary. By candidly avowing that they find themselves
enveloped in the same Stygian darkness with the
ordinary English Reader, they give him to understand that
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page237">[pg 237]</span><a name="Pg237" id="Pg237" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
there is absolutely no escape from the difficulty. What
else must be the result of all this but general uncertainty,
confusion, distress? A hazy mistrust of all Scripture has
been insinuated into the hearts and minds of countless
millions, who in this way have been <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">forced</span></em> to become doubters,—yes,
doubters in the Truth of Revelation itself. One
recals sorrowfully the terrible woe denounced by the Author
of Scripture on those who minister occasions of falling to
others:—<span class="tei tei-q">“It must needs be that offences come; but woe to
that man by whom the offence cometh!”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
For ourselves, shocked and offended at the unfaithfulness
which could so deal with the sacred Deposit, we made it our
business to expose, somewhat in detail, what had been the
method of our Revisionists. In our October number<a id="noteref_706" name="noteref_706" href="#note_706"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">706</span></span></a> we demonstrated,
(as far as was possible within such narrow limits,)
the utterly untrustworthy character of not a few of the
results at which, after ten years of careful study, these
distinguished Scholars proclaim to the civilized world that
they have deliberately arrived. In our January number<a id="noteref_707" name="noteref_707" href="#note_707"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">707</span></span></a>
also, we found it impossible to avoid extending our enumeration
of Textual errors and multiplying our proofs, while
we were making it our business to show that, even had their
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Text</span></em> been faultless, their <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Translation</span></em> must needs be rejected
as intolerable, on grounds of defective Scholarship and
egregious bad Taste. The popular verdict has in the meantime
been pronounced unmistakably. It is already admitted
on all hands that the Revision has been a prodigious blunder.
How it came about that, with such a first-rate textual Critic
among them as Prebendary Scrivener,<a id="noteref_708" name="noteref_708" href="#note_708"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">708</span></span></a> the Revisers of 1881
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page238">[pg 238]</span><a name="Pg238" id="Pg238" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
should have deliberately gone back to those vile fabrications
from which the good Providence of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">God</span></span> preserved Erasmus
and Stunica,—Stephens and Beza and the Elzevirs,—three
centuries ago:—how it happened that, with so many splendid
Scholars sitting round their table, they should have produced
a Translation which, for the most part, reads like a first-rate
school-boy's <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">crib</span></em>,—tasteless, unlovely, harsh, unidiomatic;—servile
without being really faithful,—pedantic without being
really learned;—an unreadable Translation, in short; the
result of a vast amount of labour indeed, but of wondrous
little skill:—how all this has come about, it were utterly
useless at this time of day to enquire.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page239">[pg 239]</span><a name="Pg239" id="Pg239" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Unable to disprove the correctness of our Criticism on
the Revised Greek Text, even in a single instance, certain
partizans of the Revision,—singular to relate,—have been
ever since industriously promulgating the notion, that the
Reviewer's great misfortune and fatal disadvantage all along
has been, that he wrote his first Article before the publication
of Drs. Westcott and Hort's Critical <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Introduction</span></span>.”</span>
Had he but been so happy as to have been made aware by
those eminent Scholars of the critical principles which have
guided them in the construction of their Text, how differently
must he have expressed himself throughout, and to what
widely different conclusions must he have inevitably arrived!
This is what has been once and again either openly declared,
or else privately intimated, in many quarters. Some, in the
warmth of their partizanship, have been so ill-advised as to
insinuate that it argues either a deficiency of moral courage,
or else of intellectual perception, in the Reviewer, that he has
not long since grappled definitely with the Theory of Drs.
Westcott and Hort,—and either published an Answer to it,
or else frankly admitted that he finds it unanswerable.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">a</span></span>) All of which strikes us as queer in a high degree.
First, because as a matter of fact we were careful to make it
plain that the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Introduction</span></span> in question had duly reached us
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">before the first sheet</span></em> of our earlier Article had left our hands.
To be brief,—we made it our business to procure a copy and
read it through, the instant we heard of its publication: and
on our fourteenth page (see above, pp. <a href="#Pg026" class="tei tei-ref">26-8</a>) we endeavoured
to compress into a long foot-note some account of a Theory
which (we take leave to say) can appear formidable only to
one who either lacks the patience to study it, or else the
knowledge requisite to understand it. We found that, from
a diligent perusal of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Preface</span></span> prefixed to the <span class="tei tei-q">“limited
and private issue”</span> of 1870, we had formed a perfectly correct
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page240">[pg 240]</span><a name="Pg240" id="Pg240" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
estimate of the contents of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Introduction</span></span>; and had already
characterized it with entire accuracy at pp. 24 to 29 of our
first Article. Drs. Westcott and Hort's <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">New Testament in
the original Greek</span></span> was discovered to <span class="tei tei-q">“partake inconveniently
of the nature of a work of the Imagination,”</span>—as we had
anticipated. We became easily convinced that <span class="tei tei-q">“those accomplished
Scholars had succeeded in producing a Text
vastly more remote from the inspired autographs of the
Evangelists and Apostles of our <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span></span>, than any which has
appeared since the invention of Printing.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">b</span></span>) But the queerest circumstance is behind. How is it
supposed that any amount of study of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the last new Theory</span></em> of
Textual Revision can seriously affect a Reviewer's estimate
of the evidential value of the historical <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">facts</span></em> on which he
relies for his proof that a certain exhibition of the Greek
Text is untrustworthy? The <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">onus probandi</span></span> rests clearly not
with <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">him</span></em>, but with those who call those proofs of his in
question. More of this, however, by and by. We are impatient
to get on.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">c</span></span>) And then, lastly,—What have <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">we</span></em> to do with the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Theory</span></em>
of Drs. Westcott and Hort? or indeed with the Theory of
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">any other person who can be named</span></em>? We have been examining
the new Greek Text <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">of the Revisionists</span></em>. We have condemned,
after furnishing detailed proof, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the results</span></em> at which—by
whatever means—that distinguished body of Scholars has
arrived. Surely it is competent to us to upset their <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">conclusion</span></em>,
without being constrained also to investigate in detail
the illicit logical processes by which two of their number in
a separate publication have arrived at far graver results, and
often even stand hopelessly apart, the one from the other!
We say it in no boastful spirit, but we have an undoubted
right to assume, that unless the Revisionists are able by a
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page241">[pg 241]</span><a name="Pg241" id="Pg241" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
stronger array of authorities to set aside the evidence we
have already brought forward, the calamitous destiny of their
<span class="tei tei-q">“Revision,”</span> so far as the New Testament is concerned, is
simply a thing inevitable.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Let it not be imagined, however, from what goes before,
that we desire to shirk the proposed encounter with the
advocates of this last new Text, or that we entertain the
slightest intention of doing so. We willingly accept the
assurance, that it is only because Drs. Westcott and Hort are
virtually responsible for the Revisers' Greek Text, that it is
so imperiously demanded by the Revisers and their partizans,
that the Theory of the two Cambridge Professors may be
critically examined. We can sympathize also with the secret
distress of certain of the body, who now, when it is all
too late to remedy the mischief, begin to suspect that they
have been led away by the hardihood of self-assertion;—overpowered
by the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">facundia præceps</span></span> of one who is at least a
thorough believer in his own self-evolved opinions;—imposed
upon by the seemingly consentient pages of Tischendorf and
Tregelles, Westcott and Hort.—Without further preface we
begin.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is presumed that we shall be rendering acceptable
service in certain quarters if,—before investigating the particular
Theory which has been proposed for consideration,—we
endeavour to give the unlearned English Reader some general
notion, (it must perforce be a very imperfect one,) of the
nature of the controversy to which the Theory now to be
considered belongs, and out of which it has sprung. Claiming
to be an attempt to determine the Truth of Scripture on
scientific principles, the work before us may be regarded as
the latest outcome of that violent recoil from the Traditional
Greek Text,—that strange impatience of its authority, or
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page242">[pg 242]</span><a name="Pg242" id="Pg242" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
rather denial that it possesses any authority at all,—which
began with Lachmann just 50 years ago (viz. in 1831), and
has prevailed ever since; its most conspicuous promoters
being Tregelles (1857-72) and Tischendorf (1865-72).
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The true nature of the Principles which respectively
animate the two parties in this controversy is at this time as
much as ever,—perhaps <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">more</span></em> than ever,—popularly misunderstood.
The common view of the contention in which they
are engaged, is certainly the reverse of complimentary to the
school of which Dr. Scrivener is the most accomplished living
exponent. We hear it confidently asserted that the contention
is nothing else but an irrational endeavour on the one
part to set up the many modern against the few ancient
Witnesses;—the later cursive copies against the <span class="tei tei-q">“old Uncials;”</span>—inveterate
traditional Error against undoubted primitive
Truth. The disciples of the new popular school, on the contrary,
are represented as relying exclusively <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">on Antiquity</span></em>.
We respectfully assure as many as require the assurance,
that the actual contention is of an entirely different nature.
But, before we offer a single word in the way of explanation,
let the position of our assailants at least be correctly ascertained
and clearly established. We have already been constrained
to some extent to go over this ground: but we will
not repeat ourselves. The Reader is referred back, in the
meantime, to pp. <a href="#Pg021" class="tei tei-ref">21-24</a>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Lachmann's ruling principle then, was exclusive reliance
on a very few ancient authorities—<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">because</span></em> they are <span class="tei tei-q">“ancient.”</span>
He constructed his Text on three or four,—not unfrequently
on <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">one or two</span></em>,—Greek codices. Of the Greek Fathers, he
relied on Origen. Of the oldest Versions, he cared only for
the Latin. To the Syriac (concerning which, see above, p. <a href="#Pg009" class="tei tei-ref">9</a>),
he paid no attention. We venture to think his method
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page243">[pg 243]</span><a name="Pg243" id="Pg243" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">irrational</span></em>. But this is really a point on which the thoughtful
reader is competent to judge for himself. He is invited
to read the note at foot of the page.<a id="noteref_709" name="noteref_709" href="#note_709"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">709</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Tregelles adopted the same strange method. He resorted
to a very few out of the entire mass of <span class="tei tei-q">“ancient Authorities”</span>
for the construction of his Text. His proceeding is exactly
that of a man, who—in order that he may the better explore
a comparatively unknown region—begins by putting out both
his eyes; and resolutely refuses the help of the natives
to show him the way. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Why</span></em> he rejected the testimony of
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">every Father of the IVth century, except Eusebius</span></em>,—it were
unprofitable to enquire.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Tischendorf, the last and by far the ablest Critic of the
three, knew better than to reject <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">eighty-nine ninetieths</span></em>”</span> of
the extant witnesses. He had recourse to the ingenious expedient
of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">adducing</span></em> all the available evidence, but <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">adopting</span></em>
just as little of it as he chose: and he <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">chose</span></em> to adopt those
readings only, which are vouched for by the same little band
of authorities whose partial testimony had already proved
fatal to the decrees of Lachmann and Tregelles. Happy in
having discovered (in 1859) an uncial codex (א) second in
antiquity only to the oldest before known (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b</span></span>), and strongly
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page244">[pg 244]</span><a name="Pg244" id="Pg244" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
resembling that famous IVth-century codex in the character
of its contents, he suffered his judgment to be overpowered
by the circumstance. He at once (1865-72) remodelled his
7th edition (1856-9) in 3505 places,—<span class="tei tei-q">“to the scandal of the
science of Comparative Criticism, as well as to his own grave
discredit for discernment and consistency.”</span><a id="noteref_710" name="noteref_710" href="#note_710"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">710</span></span></a> And yet he
knew concerning Cod. א, that at least ten different Revisers
from the Vth century downwards had laboured to remedy
the scandalously corrupt condition of a text which, <span class="tei tei-q">“as it
proceeded from the first scribe,”</span> even Tregelles describes as
<span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">very rough</span></em>.”</span><a id="noteref_711" name="noteref_711" href="#note_711"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">711</span></span></a> But in fact the infatuation which prevails to
this hour in this department of sacred Science can only be
spoken of as incredible. Enough has been said to show—(the
only point we are bent on establishing)—that the one
distinctive tenet of the three most famous Critics since 1831
has been a superstitious reverence for whatever is found in
the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">same little handful</span></em> of early,—but <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">not</span></em> the earliest,—<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">nor
yet of necessity the purest</span></em>,—documents.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Against this arbitrary method of theirs we solemnly, stiffly
remonstrate. <span class="tei tei-q">“Strange,”</span> we venture to exclaim, (addressing
the living representatives of the school of Lachmann,
and Tregelles, and Tischendorf):—<span class="tei tei-q">“Strange, that you should
not perceive that you are the dupes of a fallacy which
is even transparent. You <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">talk</span></em> of <span class="tei tei-q">‘Antiquity.’</span> But you must
know very well that you actually <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">mean</span></em> something different.
You fasten upon three, or perhaps four,—on two, or perhaps
three,—on <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">one, or perhaps two</span></em>,—documents of the IVth
or Vth century. But then, confessedly, these are one, two,
three, or four <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">specimens only</span></em> of Antiquity,—not <span class="tei tei-q">‘Antiquity’</span>
itself. And what if they should even prove to be <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">unfair
samples</span></em> of Antiquity? Thus, you are observed always to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page245">[pg 245]</span><a name="Pg245" id="Pg245" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
quote cod. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b</span></span> or at least cod. א. Pray, why may not the Truth
reside instead with <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a</span></span>, or <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">c</span></span>, or <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">d</span></span>?—You quote the old Latin
or the Coptic. Why may not the Peschito or the Sahidic
be right rather?—You quote either Origen or else Eusebius,—but
why not Didymus and Athanasius, Epiphanius and
Basil, Chrysostom and Theodoret, the Gregories and the
Cyrils?... It will appear therefore that we are every bit
as strongly convinced as you can be of the paramount claims
of <span class="tei tei-q">‘Antiquity:’</span> but that, eschewing prejudice and partiality,
we differ from you only in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">this</span></em>, viz. that we absolutely refuse
to bow down before the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">particular specimens of Antiquity</span></em>
which you have arbitrarily selected as the objects of your
superstition. You are illogical enough to propose to include
within your list of <span class="tei tei-q">‘ancient Authorities,’</span> codd. 1, 33 and 69,—which
are severally MSS. of the Xth, XIth, and XIVth
centuries. And why? Only because the Text of those 3
copies is observed to bear a sinister resemblance to that of
codex <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b</span></span>. But then why, in the name of common sense, do you
not show corresponding favour to the remaining 997 cursive
Copies of the N. T.,—seeing that these are observed to bear
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the same general resemblance to codex</span></em> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a</span></span>?... You are for ever
talking about <span class="tei tei-q">‘old Readings.’</span> Have you not yet discovered
that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">all</span></span> <span class="tei tei-q">‘Readings’</span> are <span class="tei tei-q">‘<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">old</span></span>’</span>?”</span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The last contribution to this department of sacred Science
is a critical edition of the New Testament by Drs. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Westcott</span></span>
and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Hort</span></span>. About this, we proceed to offer a few remarks.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I. The first thing here which unfavourably arrests attention
is the circumstance that this proves to be the only
Critical Edition of the New Testament since the days of Mill,
which does not even pretend to contribute something to our
previous critical knowledge of the subject. Mill it was
(1707) who gave us the great bulk of our various Readings;
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page246">[pg 246]</span><a name="Pg246" id="Pg246" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
which Bengel (1734) slightly, and Wetstein (1751-2) very
considerably, enlarged.—The accurate Matthæi (1782-8) acquainted
us with the contents of about 100 codices more; and
was followed by Griesbach (1796-1806) with important additional
materials.—Birch had in the meantime (1788) culled
from the principal libraries of Europe a large assortment of
new Readings: while truly marvellous was the accession of
evidence which Scholz brought to light in 1830.—And
though Lachmann (1842-50) did wondrous little in this
department, he yet furnished the critical authority (such as
it is) for his own unsatisfactory Text.—Tregelles (1857-72),
by his exact collations of MSS. and examination of the
earliest Fathers, has laid the Church under an abiding
obligation: and what is to be said of Tischendorf (1856-72),
who has contributed more to our knowledge than any other
editor of the N. T. since the days of Mill?—Dr. Scrivener,
though he has not independently edited the original Text, is
clearly to be reckoned among those who <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">have</span></em>, by reason of
his large, important, and accurate contributions to our knowledge
of ancient documents. Transfer his collections of
various Readings to the foot of the page of a copy of the
commonly Received Text,—and <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Scrivener's New Testament</span></span>”</span><a id="noteref_712" name="noteref_712" href="#note_712"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">712</span></span></a>
might stand between the editions of Mill and of Wetstein.
Let the truth be told. C. F. Matthæi and he are <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the only
two Scholars who have collated any considerable number of
sacred Codices with the needful amount of accuracy</span></em>.<a id="noteref_713" name="noteref_713" href="#note_713"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">713</span></span></a>

Now, we trust we shall be forgiven if, at the close of the
preceding enumeration, we confess to something like displeasure
at the oracular tone assumed by Drs. Westcott and
Hort in dealing with the Text of Scripture, though they
admit (page 90) that they <span class="tei tei-q">“rely for documentary evidence on
the stores accumulated by their predecessors.”</span> Confident as
those distinguished Professors may reasonably feel of their
ability to dispense with the ordinary appliances of Textual
Criticism; and proud (as they must naturally be) of a verifying
faculty which (although they are able to give no account
of it) yet enables them infallibly to discriminate between the
false and the true, as well as to assign <span class="tei tei-q">“a local habitation and
a name”</span> to every word,—inspired or uninspired,—which
purports to belong to the N. T.:—they must not be offended
with us if we freely assure them at the outset that we shall
decline to accept a single argumentative assertion of theirs
for which they fail to offer sufficient proof. Their wholly
unsupported decrees, at the risk of being thought uncivil, we
shall unceremoniously reject, as soon as we have allowed
them a hearing.

This resolve bodes ill, we freely admit, to harmonious
progress. But it is inevitable. For, to speak plainly, we
never before met with such a singular tissue of magisterial
statements, unsupported by a particle of rational evidence, as
we meet with here. The abstruse gravity, the long-winded
earnestness of the writer's manner, contrast whimsically
with the utterly inconsequential character of his antecedents
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page248">[pg 248]</span><a name="Pg248" id="Pg248" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and his consequents throughout. Professor Hort—(for <span class="tei tei-q">“the
writing of the volume and the other accompaniments of the
Text devolved”</span> on <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">him</span></em>,<a id="noteref_714" name="noteref_714" href="#note_714"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">714</span></span></a>)—Dr. Hort seems to mistake his
Opinions for facts,—his Assertions for arguments,—and a
Reiteration of either for an accession of evidence. There is
throughout the volume, apparently, a dread of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Facts</span></em> which is
even extraordinary. An actual illustration of the learned
Author's meaning,—a concrete case,—seems as if it were
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">never</span></em> forthcoming. At last it comes: but the phenomenon
is straightway discovered to admit of at least two interpretations,
and therefore never to prove the thing intended.
In a person of high education,—in one accustomed to exact
reasoning,—we should have supposed all this impossible....
But it is high time to unfold the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Introduction</span></span> at the first

II. It opens (p. 1-11) with some unsatisfactory Remarks
on <span class="tei tei-q">“Transmission by Writing;”</span> vague and inaccurate,—unsupported
by one single Textual reference,—and labouring under
the grave defect of leaving the most instructive phenomena
of the problem wholly untouched. For, inasmuch as <span class="tei tei-q">“Transmission
by writing”</span> involves two distinct classes of errors,
(1st) Those which are the result of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Accident</span></em>,—and (2ndly)
Those which are the result of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Design</span></em>,—it is to use a Reader
badly not to take the earliest opportunity of explaining to
him that what makes codd. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b</span></span> א <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">d</span></span> such utterly untrustworthy
guides, (except when supported by a large amount of extraneous
evidence,) is the circumstance that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Design</span></em> had
evidently so much to do with a vast proportion of the peculiar
errors in which they severally abound. In other words,
each of those codices clearly exhibits a fabricated Text,—is
the result of arbitrary and reckless <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Recension</span></em>.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Now, this is not a matter of opinion, but of fact. In
S. Luke's Gospel alone (collated with the traditional Text)
the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">transpositions</span></em> in codex <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b</span></span> amount to 228,—affecting 654
words: in codex <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">d</span></span>, to 464,—affecting 1401 words. Proceeding
with our examination of the same Gospel according to
S. Luke, we find that the words <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">omitted</span></em> in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b</span></span> are 757,—in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">d</span></span>,
1552. The words <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">substituted</span></em> in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b</span></span> amount to 309,—in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">d</span></span>, to
1006. The readings <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">peculiar</span></em> to <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b</span></span> are 138, and affect 215
words;—those peculiar to <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">d</span></span>, are 1731, and affect 4090
words. Wondrous few of these <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">can</span></em> have been due to accidental
causes. The Text of one or of both codices must
needs be depraved. (As for א, it is so frequently found in
accord with <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b</span></span>, that out of consideration for our Readers, we
omit the corresponding figures.)

it is entirely to misunderstand the question, to object that
the preceding Collation has been made with the Text of

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a</span></span> and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">c</span></span>, so utterly at variance with both. The simplest

III. Some remarks follow, on what is strangely styled
<span class="tei tei-q">“Transmission by printed Editions:”</span> in the course of which
Dr. Hort informs us that Lachmann's Text of 1831 was
<span class="tei tei-q">“the first founded on documentary authority.”</span><a id="noteref_716" name="noteref_716" href="#note_716"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">716</span></span></a>... On
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">what</span></em> then, pray, does the learned Professor imagine that
the Texts of Erasmus (1516) and of Stunica (1522) were
founded? His statement is incorrect. The actual difference
between Lachmann's Text and those of the earlier Editors is,
that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">his</span></em> <span class="tei tei-q">“documentary authority”</span> is partial, narrow, self-contradictory;
and is proved to be untrustworthy by a free
appeal to Antiquity. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Their</span></em> documentary authority, derived
from independent sources,—though partial and narrow as
that on which Lachmann relied,—exhibits (<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">under the good
Providence of </span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">God</span></span></em>,) a Traditional Text, the general purity
of which is demonstrated by all the evidence which 350
years of subsequent research have succeeded in accumulating;
and which is confessedly the Text of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 375.

IV. We are favoured, in the third place, with the <span class="tei tei-q">“History
of this Edition:”</span> in which the point that chiefly arrests
attention is the explanation afforded of the many and serious
occasions on which Dr. Westcott (<span class="tei tei-q">“W.”</span>) and Dr. Hort (<span class="tei tei-q">“H.”</span>),
finding it impossible to agree, have set down their respective
notions separately and subscribed them with their respective
initial. We are reminded of what was wittily said concerning
Richard Baxter: viz. that even if no one but himself
existed in the Church, <span class="tei tei-q">“Richard”</span> would still be found to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page251">[pg 251]</span><a name="Pg251" id="Pg251" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

All this reminds us painfully of certain statements made
by the same Editors in 1870:—

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
May we be permitted without offence to point out (not for
the first time) that <span class="tei tei-q">“idiosyncrasies”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“unconscious caprice,”</span>
and the fancies of the <span class="tei tei-q">“individual mind,”</span> can be allowed <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">no
place whatever</span></em> in a problem of such gravity and importance
as the present? Once admit such elements, and we are
safe to find ourselves in cloud-land to-morrow. A weaker
foundation on which to build, is not to be named. And
when we find that the learned Professors <span class="tei tei-q">“venture to hope
that the present Text has escaped some risks of this kind by
being the production of two Editors of different habits of
mind, working independently and to a great extent on
different plans,”</span>—we can but avow our conviction that the
safeguard is altogether inadequate. When two men, devoted
to the same pursuit, are in daily confidential intercourse on
such a subject, the <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">natural illusions</span></em>”</span> of either have a
marvellous tendency to communicate themselves. Their
Reader's only protection is rigidly to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">insist</span></em> on the production

V. The dissertation on <span class="tei tei-q">“Intrinsic”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“Transcriptional
Probability”</span> which follows (pp. 20-30),—being <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">unsupported
by one single instance or illustration</span></em>,—we pass by. It ignores
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page252">[pg 252]</span><a name="Pg252" id="Pg252" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
throughout the fact, that the most serious corruptions of
MSS. are due, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">not</span></em> to <span class="tei tei-q">“Scribes”</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">“Copyists,”</span> (of whom, by
the way, we find perpetual mention every time we open the
page;) but to the persons who employed them. So far from
thinking with Dr. Hort that <span class="tei tei-q">“the value of the evidence
obtained from Transcriptional Probability is incontestable,”</span>—for
that, <span class="tei tei-q">“without its aid, Textual Criticism could rarely
obtain a high degree of security,”</span> (p. 24,)—we venture to
declare that inasmuch as one expert's notions of what is
<span class="tei tei-q">“transcriptionally probable”</span> prove to be the diametrical
reverse of another expert's notions, the supposed evidence
to be derived from this source may, with advantage, be
neglected altogether. Let the study of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Documentary Evidence</span></em>
be allowed to take its place. Notions of <span class="tei tei-q">“Probability”</span> are
the very pest of those departments of Science which admit
of an appeal to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Fact</span></em>.

VI. A signal proof of the justice of our last remark is
furnished by the plea which is straightway put in (pp. 30-1)
for the superior necessity of attending to <span class="tei tei-q">“the relative antecedent

trustworthiness of documentary Authorities”</span> is
proposed as a far weightier consideration than <span class="tei tei-q">“Intrinsic”</span>

assured (in capital letters) that <span class="tei tei-q">“Knowledge of Documents

VII. We are next introduced to the subject of <span class="tei tei-q">“Genealogical

On this head, we take leave to entertain a somewhat
different opinion. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Apart from the character of the Witnesses</span></em>,
when 5 men say one thing, and 995 say the exact contradictory,
we are apt to regard it even as axiomatic that, <span class="tei tei-q">“by

Exactly so! We meant, and we mean <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">that</span></em>, and no other
thing. But then, we venture to point out, that the learned
Professor considerably understates the case: seeing that the
<span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">vice versâ presumption</span></em>”</span> is absolutely non-existent. On the
other hand, apart from <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Proof to the contrary</span></em>, we are disposed
to maintain that <span class="tei tei-q">“a majority of extant documents”</span> in the
proportion of 995 to 5,—and sometimes of 1999 to 1,—creates
more than <span class="tei tei-q">“a presumption.”</span> It amounts to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Proof of </span><span class="tei tei-q">“a

</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Not so thinks Dr. Hort. <span class="tei tei-q">“This presumption,”</span> (he seems to
have persuaded himself,) may be disposed of by his mere
assertion that it <span class="tei tei-q">“is too minute to weigh against the smallest
tangible evidence of other kinds”</span> (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ibid.</span></span>). As usual, however,
he furnishes us with <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">no evidence at all</span></em>,—<span class="tei tei-q">“tangible”</span> or
<span class="tei tei-q">“intangible.”</span> Can he wonder if we smile at his unsupported
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">dictum</span></span>, and pass on?... The argumentative import of his
twenty weary pages on <span class="tei tei-q">“Genealogical Evidence”</span> (pp. 39-59),
appears to be resolvable into the following barren truism:
viz. That if, out of 10 copies of Scripture, 9 <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">could be proved</span></em>
to have been executed from one and the same common
original (p. 41), those 9 would cease to be regarded as 9
independent witnesses. But does the learned Critic really
require to be told that we want no diagram of an imaginary
case (p. 54) to convince us of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">that</span></em>?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The one thing here which moves our astonishment, is, that
Dr. Hort does not seem to reflect that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">therefore</span></em> (indeed <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">by
his own showing</span></em>) codices <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b</span></span> and א, having been <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">demonstrably</span></em>
<span class="tei tei-q">“executed from one and the same common original,”</span> are not
to be reckoned as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">two</span></em> independent witnesses to the Text of
the New Testament, but as little more than <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">one</span></em>. (See p. 257.)

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
High time however is it to declare that, in strictness,
all this talk about <span class="tei tei-q">“Genealogical evidence,”</span> when applied to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page256">[pg 256]</span><a name="Pg256" id="Pg256" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Manuscripts, is—<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">moonshine</span></em>. The expression is metaphorical,
and assumes that it has fared with MSS. as it fares with the
successive generations of a family; and so, to a remarkable
extent, no doubt, it <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">has</span></em>. But then, it happens, unfortunately,
that we are unacquainted with <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">one single instance</span></em> of a known
MS. copied from another known MS. And perforce all talk
about <span class="tei tei-q">“Genealogical evidence,”</span> where <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">no single step in the
descent</span></em> can be produced,—in other words, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">where no Genealogical
evidence exists</span></em>,—is absurd. The living inhabitants
of a village, congregated in the churchyard where the
bodies of their forgotten progenitors for 1000 years repose
without memorials of any kind,—is a faint image of the
relation which subsists between extant copies of the Gospels
and the sources from which they were derived. That, in
either case, there has been repeated mixture, is undeniable;
but since the Parish-register is lost, and not a vestige of
Tradition survives, it is idle to pretend to argue on <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">that</span></em> part
of the subject. It may be reasonably assumed however
that those 50 yeomen, bearing as many Saxon surnames,
indicate as many remote <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ancestors</span></em> of some sort. That they
represent as many <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">families</span></em>, is at least a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">fact</span></em>. Further we
cannot go.

But the illustration is misleading, because inadequate.
Assemble rather an Englishman, an Irishman, a Scot; a
Frenchman, a German, a Spaniard; a Russian, a Pole, an
Hungarian; an Italian, a Greek, a Turk. From Noah these
12 are all confessedly descended; but if <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">they</span></em> are silent, and
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">you</span></em> know nothing whatever about their antecedents,—your
remarks about their respective <span class="tei tei-q">“genealogies”</span> must needs
prove as barren—as Dr. Hort's about the <span class="tei tei-q">“genealogies”</span> of
copies of Scripture. <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">The factor of Genealogy</span></em>,”</span> in short, in

The nearest approximation to the phenomenon about which
Dr. Hort writes so glibly, is supplied—(1) by Codd. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">f</span></span> and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">g</span></span>
of S. Paul, which are found to be independent transcripts of
the same venerable lost original:—(2) by Codd. 13, 69, 124
and 346, which were confessedly derived from one and the
same queer archetype: <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">and especially</span></em>—(3) by Codd. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b</span></span> and א.
These two famous manuscripts, because they are disfigured
exclusively by the self-same mistakes, are convicted of being
descended (and not very remotely) from the self-same very
corrupt original. By consequence, the combined evidence
of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">f</span></span> and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">g</span></span> is but that of a single codex. Evan. 13, 69, 124,
346, when they agree, would be conveniently designated by
a symbol, or a single capital letter. Codd. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b</span></span> and א, as already
hinted (p. <a href="#Pg255" class="tei tei-ref">255</a>), are not to be reckoned as two witnesses.
Certainly, they have not nearly the Textual significancy and
importance of B in conjunction with <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a</span></span>, or of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a</span></span> in conjunction
with <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">c</span></span>. At best, they do but equal 1-½ copies. Nothing of
this kind however is what Drs. Westcott and Hort intend
to convey,—or indeed seem to understand.

VIII. It is not until we reach p. 94, that these learned men
favour us with a single actual appeal to Scripture. At p. 90,
Dr. Hort,—who has hitherto been skirmishing over the
ground, and leaving us to wonder what in the world it can
be that he is driving at,—announces a chapter on the
<span class="tei tei-q">“Results of Genealogical evidence proper;”</span> and proposes to
<span class="tei tei-q">“determine the Genealogical relations of the chief ancient
Texts.”</span> Impatient for argument, (at page 92,) we read as
follows:—

ourselves of his candid admission, by and by.

Having thus <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">assumed</span></em> a <span class="tei tei-q">“dominant Antiochian or Græco-Syrian
text of the second half of the IVth century,”</span> Dr. H.
attempts, by an analysis of what he is pleased to call <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">conflate</span></em>
Readings,”</span> to prove the <span class="tei tei-q">“posteriority of <span class="tei tei-q">‘Syrian’</span> to
<span class="tei tei-q">‘Western’</span> and other <span class="tei tei-q">‘Neutral’</span> readings.”</span>... Strange
method of procedure! seeing that, of those second and third
classes of readings, we have not as yet so much as heard
the names. Let us however without more delay be shown
those specimens of <span class="tei tei-q">“Conflation”</span> which, in Dr. Hort's judgment,
supply <span class="tei tei-q">“the clearest evidence”</span> (p. 94) that <span class="tei tei-q">“Syrian”</span>
are posterior alike to <span class="tei tei-q">“Western”</span> and to <span class="tei tei-q">“Neutral readings.”</span>
Of these, after 30 years of laborious research, Dr. Westcott

to fill up the space at our disposal with details which
none but professed students will care to read;—and because,
on the other, we cannot afford to pass by anything in these
pages which pretends to be of the nature of proof;—we have
consigned our account of Dr. Hort's 8 instances of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Conflation</span></em>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">b</span></span>) Dr. Hort has detected <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">four</span></em> instances in S. Mark's
Gospel, only <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">three</span></em> in S. Luke's—<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">seven</span></em> in all—where Codices

same place</span></em>, but not <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">of the same words</span></em>. We shall probably
be best understood if we produce an instance of the thing
spoken of: and no fairer example can be imagined than the
last of the eight, of which Dr. Hort says,—<span class="tei tei-q">“This simple instance
needs no explanation”</span> (p. 104). Instead of αἰνοῦντες καὶ
εὐλογοῦντες,—(which is the reading of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">every known copy</span></em> of
the Gospels <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">except five</span></em>,)—א <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b c l</span></span> exhibit only εὐλογοῦντες:

αἰνοῦντες καί and are followed by Westcott and Hort: <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">d</span></span>
omits καὶ εὐλογοῦντες, and is followed by Tischendorf.
Lachmann declines to follow either. Tregelles doubts.)

(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">c</span></span>) Now, upon this (and the six other instances, which
however prove to be a vast deal less apt for their purpose
than the present), these learned men have gratuitously built
up the following extravagant and astonishing theory:—

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">d</span></span>) They assume,—(they do not attempt to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">prove</span></em>: in fact
they <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">never</span></em> prove <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">anything</span></em>:)—(1) That αἰνοῦντες καί—and
καὶ εὐλογοῦντες—are respectively fragments of two independent
Primitive Texts, which they arbitrarily designate as
<span class="tei tei-q">“Western”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“Neutral,”</span> respectively:—(2) That the latter
of the two, [<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">only</span></em> however because it is vouched for by <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b</span></span>
and א,] must needs exhibit what the Evangelist actually
wrote: [though <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">why</span></em> it must, these learned men forget to
explain:]—(3) That in the middle of the IIIrd and of the
IVth century the two Texts referred to were with design
and by authority welded together, and became (what the
same irresponsible Critics are pleased to call) the <span class="tei tei-q">“Syrian
text.”</span>—(4) That αἰνοῦντες καὶ εὐλογοῦντες, being thus shown [?]
to be <span class="tei tei-q">“a Syrian <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Conflation</span></em>,”</span> may be rejected at once. (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Notes</span></span>,

X. But we demur to this weak imagination, (which only
by courtesy can be called <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">a Theory</span></em>,”</span>) on every ground, and
are constrained to remonstrate with our would-be Guides at
every step. They assume everything. They prove nothing.
And the facts of the case lend them no favour at all.
For first,—We only find εὐλογοῦντες standing alone, in two
documents of the IVth century, in two of the Vth, and in
one of the VIIIth: while, for αἰνοῦντες standing alone, the
only Greek voucher producible is a notoriously corrupt copy
of the VIth century. True, that here a few copies of the
old Latin side with <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">d</span></span>: but then a few copies <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">also</span></em> side with
the traditional Text: and Jerome is found to have adjudicated
between their rival claims <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in favour of the latter</span></em>. The
probabilities of the case are in fact simply overwhelming;
for, since <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">d</span></span> omits 1552 words out of 19,941 (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> about one
word in 13), <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">why</span></em> may not καὶ εὐλογοῦντες <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">be two of the words
it omits</span></em>,—in which case there has been no <span class="tei tei-q">“Conflation”</span>?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Nay, look into the matter a little more closely:—(for surely,
before we put up with this queer illusion, it is our duty to
look it very steadily in the face:)—and note, that in this
last chapter of S. Luke's Gospel, which consists of 837
words, no less than 121 are omitted by cod. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">d</span></span>. To state the
case differently,—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">d</span></span> is observed to leave out <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">one word in seven</span></em>
in the very chapter of S. Luke which supplies the instance of
<span class="tei tei-q">“Conflation”</span> under review. What possible significance therefore
can be supposed to attach to its omission of the clause
καὶ εὐλογοῦντες? And since, <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">mutatis mutandis</span></span>, the same remarks
apply to the 6 remaining cases,—(for one, viz. the [7th],
is clearly an oversight,)—will any Reader of ordinary fairness
and intelligence be surprised to hear that we reject the
assumed <span class="tei tei-q">“Conflation”</span> unconditionally, as a silly dream?
It is founded entirely upon the omission of 21 (or at most
42) words out of a total of 31,587 from Codd. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b</span></span> א <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">d</span></span>. And
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page265">[pg 265]</span><a name="Pg265" id="Pg265" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
yet it is demonstrable that out of that total, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b</span></span> omits 1519:
א, 1686: <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">d</span></span>, 2452. The occasional <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">coincidence in Omission</span></em> of
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b</span></span> + א and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">d</span></span>, was in a manner inevitable, and is undeserving
of notice. If,—(which is as likely as not,)—on <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">six</span></em> occasions,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b</span></span> + א and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">d</span></span> have but <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">omitted different words in the same
sentence</span></em>, then <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">there has been no </span><span class="tei tei-q">“Conflation”</span></em>; and the (so-called)
<span class="tei tei-q">“Theory,”</span> which was to have revolutionized the Text of the
N. T., is discovered to rest absolutely <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">upon nothing</span></em>. It
bursts, like a very thin bubble: floats away like a film of
gossamer, and disappears from sight.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But further, as a matter of fact, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">at least five</span></em> out of the
eight instances cited,—viz. the [1st], [2nd], [5th], [6th], [7th],—<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">fail
to exhibit the alleged phenomena</span></em>: conspicuously ought
never to have been adduced. For, in the [1st], <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">d</span></span> merely
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">abridges</span></em> the sentence: in the [2nd], it <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">paraphrases</span></em> 11 words
by 11; and in the [6th], it <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">paraphrases</span></em> 12 words by 9. In the
[5th], <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b</span></span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">d</span></span> merely <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">abridge</span></em>. The utmost <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">residuum</span></em> of fact which
survives, is therefore as follows:—

How <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">any</span></em> rational Textual Theory is to be constructed

realizing the insecurity of the ground under their feet, proceed
gravely to build upon it, and to treat their hypothetical

Trenchant decrees of this kind at last arrest attention.
It becomes apparent that we have to do with a Writer who
has discovered a summary way of dealing with the Text of
Scripture, and who is prepared to impart his secret to any
who care to accept—without questioning—his views. We
look back to see where this accession of confidence began,
and are reminded that at p. 108 Dr. Hort announced that for
convenience he should henceforth speak of certain <span class="tei tei-q">“groups of
documents,”</span> by the conventional names <span class="tei tei-q">“Western”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“Pre-Syrian”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“Alexandrian”</span>—and
so forth. Accordingly, ever
since, (sometimes eight or ten times in the course of a single
page,<a id="noteref_719" name="noteref_719" href="#note_719"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">719</span></span></a>) we have encountered this arbitrary terminology: have
been required to accept it as the expression of ascertained
facts in Textual Science. Not till we find ourselves floundering
in the deep mire, do we become fully aware of the
absurdity of our position. Then at last, (and high time too!),
we insist on knowing what on earth our Guide is about,
and whither he is proposing to lead us?... More considerate
to our Readers than he has been to us, we propose
before going any further, (instead of mystifying the subject
as Dr. Hort has done,) to state in a few plain words what
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page269">[pg 269]</span><a name="Pg269" id="Pg269" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

XIII. The one great Fact, which especially troubles him

Greek Text</span></em> of the New Testament Scriptures. Call this Text
Erasmian or Complutensian,—the Text of Stephens, or of
Beza, or of the Elzevirs,—call it the <span class="tei tei-q">“Received,”</span> or the
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Traditional Greek Text</span></em>, or whatever other name you please;—the
fact remains, that a Text <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">has</span></em> come down to us which
is attested by a general consensus of ancient Copies, ancient
Fathers, ancient Versions. This, at all events, is a point on
which, (happily,) there exists entire conformity of opinion
between Dr. Hort and ourselves. Our Readers cannot have
yet forgotten his virtual admission that,—<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Beyond all question
the Textus Receptus</span></em> is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the dominant Græco-Syrian Text of</span></em>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Obtained from a variety of sources, this Text proves to be
essentially <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the same</span></em> in all. That it requires Revision in
respect of many of its lesser details, is undeniable: but it is
at least as certain that it is an excellent Text as it stands, and
that the use of it will never lead critical students of Scripture
seriously astray,—which is what no one will venture to predicate
concerning any single Critical Edition of the N. T. which
has been published since the days of Griesbach, by the
disciples of Griesbach's school.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
XIV. In marked contrast to the Text we speak of,—(which
is identical with the Text of every extant Lectionary of the
Greek Church, and may therefore reasonably claim to be
spoken of as the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Traditional</span></em> Text,)—is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">that</span></em> contained in a
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page270">[pg 270]</span><a name="Pg270" id="Pg270" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
little handful of documents of which the most famous are
codices <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b</span></span> א, and the Coptic Version (as far as it is known), on
the one hand,—cod. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">d</span></span> and the old Latin copies, on the other.
To magnify the merits of these, as helps and guides, and
to ignore their many patent and scandalous defects and
blemishes:—<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">per fas et nefas</span></span> to vindicate their paramount
authority wherever it is in any way possible to do so; and
when <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">that</span></em> is clearly impossible, then to treat their errors as
the ancient Egyptians treated their cats, dogs, monkeys, and
other vermin,—namely, to embalm them, and pay them
Divine honours:—<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">such</span></em> for the last 50 years has been the
practice of the dominant school of Textual Criticism among
ourselves. The natural and even necessary correlative of
this, has been the disparagement of the merits of the commonly
Received Text: which has come to be spoken of, (we
know not why,) as contemptuously, almost as bitterly, as if
it had been at last ascertained to be untrustworthy in every
respect: a thing undeserving alike of a place and of a name
among the monuments of the Past. Even to have <span class="tei tei-q">“used the
Received Text <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">as a basis for correction</span></em>”</span> (p. 184) is stigmatized
by Dr. Hort as one <span class="tei tei-q">“great cause”</span> why Griesbach went astray.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
XV. Drs. Westcott and Hort have in fact outstripped their
predecessors in this singular race. Their absolute contempt for
the Traditional Text,—their superstitious veneration for a few
ancient documents; (which documents however they freely
confess <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">are not more ancient</span></em> than the <span class="tei tei-q">“Traditional Text”</span> which
they despise;)—knows no bounds. But the thing just now to
be attended to is the argumentative process whereby they
seek to justify their preference.—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lachmann</span></span> avowedly took
his stand on a very few of the oldest known documents: and
though <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Tregelles</span></span> slightly enlarged the area of his predecessor's
observations, his method was practically identical
with that of Lachmann.—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Tischendorf</span></span>, appealing to every
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page271">[pg 271]</span><a name="Pg271" id="Pg271" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
known authority, invariably shows himself regardless of the
evidence he has himself accumulated. Where certain of the
uncials are,—<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">there</span></em> his verdict is sure also to be.... Anything
more unscientific, more unphilosophical, more transparently
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">foolish</span></em> than such a method, can scarcely be conceived:
but it has prevailed for 50 years, and is now at last
more hotly than ever advocated by Drs. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Westcott</span></span> and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Hort</span></span>.

XVI. Their expedient has been as follows.—Aware that
the Received or Traditional Greek Text (to quote their own
words,) <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">is virtually identical with that used by Chrysostom and
other Antiochian Fathers in the latter part of the IVth century</span></em>:”</span>
and fully alive to the fact that it <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">must therefore have
been represented by Manuscripts as old as any which are
now surviving</span></em>”</span> (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Text</span></span>, p. 547),—they have invented an extraordinary
Hypothesis in order to account for its existence:—
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
They assume that the writings of Origen <span class="tei tei-q">“establish the prior
existence of at least three types of Text:”</span>—the most clearly
marked of which, they call the <span class="tei tei-q">“Western:”</span>—another, less
prominent, they designate as <span class="tei tei-q">“Alexandrian:”</span>—the third holds
(they say) a middle or <span class="tei tei-q">“Neutral”</span> position. (That all this is
mere <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">moonshine</span></em>,—a day-dream and no more,—we shall insist,
until some proofs have been produced that the respected
Authors are moving amid material forms,—not discoursing
with the creations of their own brain.) <span class="tei tei-q">“The priority of two
at least of these three Texts just noticed to the Syrian Text,”</span>
they are confident has been established by the eight <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">conflate</span></em>”</span>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page272">[pg 272]</span><a name="Pg272" id="Pg272" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Syrian Readings which they flatter themselves they have
already resolved into their <span class="tei tei-q">“Western”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“Neutral”</span> elements
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Text</span></span>, p. 547). This, however, is a part of the subject on
which we venture to hope that our Readers by this time have
formed a tolerably clear opinion for themselves. The ground
has been cleared of the flimsy superstructure which these
Critics have been 30 years in raising, ever since we blew
away (pp. <a href="#Pg258" class="tei tei-ref">258-65</a>) the airy foundation on which it rested.

They were evidently anxious to remove all
stumbling-blocks out of the way of the ordinary reader, so

They were apparently equally desirous that he should have the
benefit of instructive matter contained in all the existing Texts,
provided it did not confuse the context or introduce seeming
contradictions. New Omissions accordingly are rare, and where
they occur are usually found to contribute to apparent simplicity.
New Interpolations, on the other hand, are abundant,
most of them being due to harmonistic or other assimilation,
fortunately capricious and incomplete. Both in matter and in
diction </span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-variant: small-caps">the Syrian Text</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%"> is conspicuously a full Text. It delights

XIX. But how does it happen—(let the question be asked
without offence)—that a man of good abilities, bred in a
University which is supposed to cultivate especially the
Science of exact reasoning, should habitually allow himself
in such slipshod writing as this? The very <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">fact</span></em> of a <span class="tei tei-q">“Revision”</span>
of the Syriac has all to be proved; and until it has

fact. Instead of demonstration, we find ourselves invited (1)—<span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">To
suppose</span></em>”</span> that such a Revision took place: and (2)—<span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">To
suppose</span></em>”</span> that all our existing Manuscripts represent it. But
(as we have said) not a shadow of reason is produced why
we should be so complaisant as <span class="tei tei-q">“to suppose”</span> either the one
thing or the other. In the meantime, the accomplished Critic

of was <span class="tei tei-q">“deliberate, and in some way authoritative.”</span>

Peschito the <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Syriac</span></em> Vulgate,”</span>—as confidently as Jerome's
Revision of the old Latin is styled the <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Latin</span></em> Vulgate.”</span> They
even assure us that <span class="tei tei-q">“Cureton's Syriac”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“renders the comparatively
late and <span class="tei tei-q">‘revised’</span> character of the Syriac Vulgate <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">a
matter of certainty</span></em>”</span> (p. 84). The very city in which the
latter underwent Revision, can, it seems, be fixed with
<span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">tolerable certainty</span></em>”</span> (p. 136).... Can Dr. Hort be serious?

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
At the end of a series of conjectures, (the foundation of
which is the hypothesis of an Antiochian Recension of the
Greek,) the learned writer announces that—<span class="tei tei-q">“The textual

XX. Now, instead of insisting that this entire Theory
is made up of a series of purely gratuitous assumptions,—destitute
alike of attestation and of probability: and that, as
a mere effort of the Imagination, it is entitled to no manner
of consideration or respect at our hands:—instead of dealing
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">thus</span></em> with what precedes, we propose to be most kind and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page278">[pg 278]</span><a name="Pg278" id="Pg278" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
accommodating to Dr. Hort. We proceed <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">to accept his
Theory in its entirety</span></em>. We will, with the Reader's permission,
assume that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">all</span></em> he tells us is historically true: is an
authentic narrative of what actually did take place. We
shall in the end invite the same Reader to recognize the
inevitable consequences of our admission: to which we shall
inexorably pin the learned Editors—bind them hand and
foot;—of course reserving to ourselves the right of disallowing
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">for ourselves</span></em> as much of the matter as we please.

Somewhere between <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 250 and 350 therefore,—(<span class="tei tei-q">“it is
impossible to say with confidence”</span> [p. 137] what was the
actual date, but these Editors evidently incline to the latter
half of the IIIrd century, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">circa</span></span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 275);—we are to
believe that the Ecclesiastical heads of the four great Patriarchates
of Eastern Christendom,—Alexandria, Antioch,
Jerusalem, Constantinople,—had become so troubled at
witnessing the prevalence of depraved copies of Holy
Scripture in their respective churches, that they resolved by
common consent on achieving an authoritative Revision
which should henceforth become the standard Text of all the
Patriarchates of the East. The same sentiment of distress—(by
the hypothesis) penetrated into Syria proper; and the
Bishops of Edessa or Nisibis, (<span class="tei tei-q">“great centres of life and
culture to the Churches whose language was Syriac,”</span> [p. 136,])
lent themselves so effectually to the project, that a single
fragmentary document is, at the present day, the only vestige
remaining of the Text which before had been universally
prevalent in the Syriac-speaking Churches of antiquity. <span class="tei tei-q">“The
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">almost total extinction of Old Syriac MSS.</span></em>, contrasted with the
great number of extant <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Vulgate Syriac MSS.</span></em>,”</span>—(for it is thus
that Dr. Hort habitually exhibits evidence!),—is to be attributed,
it seems, to the power and influence of the Authors
of the imaginary Syriac Revision. [<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ibid.</span></span>] Bp. Ellicott, by
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page279">[pg 279]</span><a name="Pg279" id="Pg279" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

Syriac as <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">singular and sometimes rather wild</span></em>.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">The text, of
a very composite nature</span></em>; sometimes <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">inclining to the shortness
and simplicity of the Vatican manuscript, but more commonly
presenting the same paraphrastic character of text as the Codex
Bezæ</span></em>.”</span> [p. 42.] (It is, in fact, an <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">utterly depraved</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">fabricated</span></em>
document.)
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We venture to remark in passing that Textual matters
must have everywhere reached a very alarming pass indeed
to render intelligible the resort to so extraordinary a step as
a representative Conference of the <span class="tei tei-q">“leading Personages or
Sees”</span> (p. 134) of Eastern Christendom. The inference is at
least inevitable, that men in high place at that time deemed
themselves competent to grapple with the problem. Enough
was familiarly known about the character and the sources of
these corrupt Texts to make it certain that they would be
recognizable when produced; and that, when condemned by
authority, they would no longer be propagated, and in the
end would cease to molest the Church. Thus much, at all
events, is legitimately to be inferred from the hypothesis.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
XXI. Behold then from every principal Diocese of ancient
Christendom, and in the Church's palmiest days, the most
famous of the ante-Nicene Fathers repair to Antioch. They
go up by authority, and are attended by skilled Ecclesiastics
of the highest theological attainment. Bearers are they
perforce of a vast number of Copies of the Scriptures: and
(by the hypothesis) <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the latest possible dates</span></em> of any of these
Copies must range between <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 250 and 350. But the
Delegates of so many ancient Sees will have been supremely
careful, before starting on so important and solemn an
errand, to make diligent search for the oldest Copies anywhere
discoverable: and when they reach the scene of their
deliberations, we may be certain that they are able to appeal
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page280">[pg 280]</span><a name="Pg280" id="Pg280" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
to not a few codices <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">written within a hundred years of the</span></em>
date of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">inspired Autographs</span></em> themselves. Copies of the
Scriptures authenticated as having belonged to the most
famous of their predecessors,—and held by them in high
repute for the presumed purity of their Texts—will have been
freely produced: while, in select receptacles, will have been
stowed away—for purposes of comparison and avoidance—specimens
of those dreaded Texts whose existence has been
the sole cause why (by the hypothesis) this extraordinary
concourse of learned Ecclesiastics has taken place.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
After solemnly invoking the Divine blessing, these men
address themselves assiduously to their task; and (by the
hypothesis) they proceed to condemn every codex which
exhibits a <span class="tei tei-q">“strictly Western,”</span> or a <span class="tei tei-q">“strictly Alexandrian,”</span> or a
<span class="tei tei-q">“strictly Neutral”</span> type. In plain English, if codices <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b</span></span>, א,
and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">d</span></span> had been before them, they would have unceremoniously
rejected all three; but then, (by the hypothesis)
neither of the two first-named had yet come into being:
while 200 years at least must roll out before Cod. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">d</span></span> would
see the light. In the meantime, the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">immediate ancestors</span></em> of
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b</span></span> א and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">d</span></span> will perforce have come under judicial scrutiny;
and, (by the hypothesis,) they will have been scornfully
rejected by the general consent of the Judges.

XXII. Pass an interval—(are we to suppose of fifty

and learning of the four great Patriarchates of the East,
formally represented at Antioch! The Church is now in her
palmiest days. Some of her greatest men belong to the
period of which we are speaking. Eusebius (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 308-340)
is in his glory. One whole generation has come and
gone since the last Textual Conference was held, at Antioch.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page281">[pg 281]</span><a name="Pg281" id="Pg281" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Yet is no inclination manifested to reverse the decrees of the
earlier Conference. This second Recension of the Text of
Scripture does but <span class="tei tei-q">“carry out more completely the purposes
of the first;”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“the final process was apparently completed
by <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 350”</span> (p. 137).—So far the Cambridge Professor.

XXIII. But the one important fact implied by this
august deliberation concerning the Text of Scripture has
been conveniently passed over by Dr. Hort in profound
silence. We take leave to repair his omission by inviting
the Reader's particular attention to it.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We request him to note that, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">by the hypothesis</span></em>, there will
have been submitted to the scrutiny of these many ancient
Ecclesiastics <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">not a few codices of exactly the same type as

to specify with precision certain features which the codices
in question will have all concurred in exhibiting. Thus,—
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(1) From S. Mark's Gospel, those depraved copies will
have omitted <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">the last Twelve Verses</span></span> (xvi. 9-20).
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(2) From S. Luke's Gospel the same corrupt copies will
have omitted our <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Saviour's Agony in the Garden</span></span> (xxii.
43, 44).
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(3) His <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Prayer on behalf of His murderers</span></span> (xxiii. 34),
will have also been away.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(4) The <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Inscription on the Cross</span></span>, in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Greek, Latin, and
Hebrew</span></span> (xxiii. 38), will have been partly, misrepresented,—partly,
away.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(5) And there will have been no account discoverable of
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">S. Peter's Visit to the Sepulchre</span></span> (xxiv. 12).
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">

Ascension into Heaven</span></span> (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ibid.</span></span> 51).
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(7) Also, from S. John's Gospel, the codices in question
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page282">[pg 282]</span><a name="Pg282" id="Pg282" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
will have omitted the incident of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">the troubling of the
pool of Bethesda</span></span> (v. 3, 4).
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Now, we request that it may be clearly noted that,
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">according to Dr. Hort</span></em>, against every copy of the Gospels so
maimed and mutilated, (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">against every copy of the Gospels
of the same type as codices</span></em> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b</span></span> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">and</span></em> א,)—the many illustrious
Bishops who, (<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">still</span></em> according to Dr. Hort,) assembled at
Antioch, first in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 250 and then in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 350,—by common
consent set a mark of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">condemnation</span></em>. We are assured that
those famous men,—those Fathers of the Church,—were
emphatic in their sanction, instead, of codices of the type
of Cod. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a</span></span>,—in which all these seven omitted passages (and
many hundreds besides) are duly found in their proper
places.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
When, therefore, at the end of a thousand and half a
thousand years, Dr. Hort (guided by his inner consciousness,
and depending on an intellectual illumination of which he is
able to give no intelligible account) proposes to reverse the
deliberate sentence of Antiquity,—his position strikes us as
bordering on the ludicrous. Concerning the seven places above
referred to, which the assembled Fathers pronounce to be
genuine Scripture, and declare to be worthy of all acceptation,—Dr.
Hort expresses himself in terms which—could
they have been heard at Antioch—must, it is thought, have
brought down upon his head tokens of displeasure which
might have even proved inconvenient. But let the respected
gentleman by all means be allowed to speak for himself:—
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(1) <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">The last Twelve Verses</span></span> of S. Mark (he would have
been heard to say) are a <span class="tei tei-q">“very early interpolation.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Its
authorship and precise date must remain unknown.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“It
manifestly cannot claim any Apostolic authority.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“It is

pp. 46 and 51.)
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(2) <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">The Agony in the Garden</span></span> (he would have told them)
is <span class="tei tei-q">“an early Western interpolation,”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“can only be a
fragment from traditions, written or oral,”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“rescued from
oblivion by the scribes of the second century.”</span>—(pp. 66-7.)
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(3) <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">The Prayer of our Lord for His Murderers</span></span> (Dr.
Hort would have said),—<span class="tei tei-q">“I cannot doubt comes from an
extraneous source.”</span> It is <span class="tei tei-q">“a Western interpolation.”</span>—(p.68.)

(4) <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">To the Inscription on the Cross, in Greek, Latin,

so much as a hearing.

(5) The spuriousness of the narrative of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">S. Peter's Visit
to the Sepulchre</span></span> [S. Luke xxiv. 12] (the same Ante-Nicene
Fathers would have learned) he regards as a <span class="tei tei-q">“moral certainty.”</span>
He would have assured them that it is <span class="tei tei-q">“a Western non-interpolation.”</span>—(p.
71.)
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(6) They would have learned that, in the account of the
same Critic, S. Luke xxiv. 51 is another spurious addition to
the inspired Text: another <span class="tei tei-q">“Western non-interpolation.”</span>
Dr. Hort would have tried to persuade them that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">our Lord's
Ascension into Heaven</span></span> <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">was evidently inserted from an
assumption</span></em> that a separation from the disciples at the close
of a Gospel <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">must be the Ascension</span></em>,”</span> (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Notes</span></span>, p. 73).... (What
the Ante-Nicene Fathers would have thought of their teacher

(7) <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">The Troubling of the pool of Bethesda</span></span> [S. John v.
3, 4] is not even allowed a bracketed place in Dr. Hort's
Text. How the accomplished Critic would have set about
persuading the Ante-Nicene Fathers that they were in error
for holding it to be genuine Scripture, it is hard to imagine.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
XXIV. It is plain therefore that Dr. Hort is in direct
antagonism with the collective mind of Patristic Antiquity.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page284">[pg 284]</span><a name="Pg284" id="Pg284" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Why</span></em>, when it suits him, he should appeal to the same
Ancients for support,—we fail to understand. <span class="tei tei-q">“If Baal be
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">God</span></span>, then follow <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">him</span></em>!”</span> Dr. Hort has his codex <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b</span></span> and his
codex א to guide him. He informs us (p. 276) that <span class="tei tei-q">“the fullest
consideration does but increase the conviction that the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">pre-eminent
relative purity</span></em>”</span> of those two codices <span class="tei tei-q">“is approximately
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">absolute</span></em>,—<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">a true approximate reproduction of the Text of the
Autographs</span></em>.”</span> On the other hand, he has discovered that
the Received Text is virtually the production of the Fathers
of the Nicene Age (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 250-<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 350),—exhibits a Text
fabricated throughout by the united efforts of those well-intentioned
but thoroughly misguided men. What is it to
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">him</span></em>, henceforth, how Athanasius, or Didymus, or Cyril exhibits
a place?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Yes, we repeat it,—Dr. Hort is in direct antagonism with
the Fathers of the IIIrd and the IVth Century. His own
fantastic hypothesis of a <span class="tei tei-q">“Syrian Text,”</span>—the solemn expression
of the collective wisdom and deliberate judgment
of the Fathers of the Nicene Age (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 250-<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 350),—is the
best answer which can by possibility be invented to his own
pages,—is, in our account, the one sufficient and conclusive
refutation of his own Text.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Thus, his prolix and perverse discussion of S. Mark xvi.
9-20 (viz. from p. 28 to p. 51 of his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Notes</span></span>),—which, carefully
analysed, is found merely to amount to <span class="tei tei-q">“Thank you for showing
us our mistake; but we mean to stick to our <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Mumpsimus</span></em>!”</span>:—those
many inferences as well from what the
Fathers do <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">not</span></em> say, as from what they <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">do</span></em>;—are all effectually
disposed of by his own theory of a <span class="tei tei-q">“Syrian text.”</span> A mighty
array of forgotten Bishops, Fathers, Doctors of the Nicene
period, come back and calmly assure the accomplished Professor
that the evidence on which he relies is but an insignificant
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page285">[pg 285]</span><a name="Pg285" id="Pg285" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
fraction of the evidence which was before themselves
when they delivered their judgment. <span class="tei tei-q">“Had you known but
the thousandth part of what we knew familiarly,”</span> say they,
<span class="tei tei-q">“you would have spared yourself this exposure. You seem
to have forgotten that Eusebius was one of the chief persons
in our assembly; that Cyril of Jerusalem and Athanasius,
Basil and Gregory of Nazianzus, as well as his namesake
of Nyssa,—were all living when we held our Textual Conference,
and some of them, though young men, were even
parties to our decree.”</span>... Now, as an <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">argumentum ad
hominem</span></span>, this, be it observed, is decisive and admits of no

XXV. How then about those <span class="tei tei-q">“Syrian <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Conflations</span></em>”</span> concerning
which a few pages back we heard so much, and for
which Dr. Hort considers the august tribunal of which we
are now speaking to be responsible? He is convinced that
the (so-called) Syrian Text (which he regards as the product
of their deliberations), is <span class="tei tei-q">“an eclectic text <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">combining Readings
from the three principal Texts</span></em>”</span> (p. 145): which Readings in
consequence he calls <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">conflate</span></em>.”</span> How then is it to be supposed
that these <span class="tei tei-q">“Conflations”</span> arose? The answer is obvious.
As <span class="tei tei-q">“Conflations,”</span> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">they have no existence</span></em>,—save in the fertile
brain of Dr. Hort. Could the ante-Nicene fathers who
never met at Antioch have been interrogated by him concerning
this matter,—(let the Hibernian supposition be
allowed for argument sake!)—they would perforce have made
answer,—<span class="tei tei-q">“You quite mistake the purpose for which we came
together, learned sir! You are evidently thinking of your
Jerusalem Chamber and of the unheard-of method devised by
your Bishop”</span> [see pp. 37 to 39: also p. 273] <span class="tei tei-q">“for ascertaining
the Truth of Scripture. Well may the resuscitation of so many
forgotten blunders have occupied you and your colleagues
for as long a period as was expended on the Siege of Troy!

spurious Texts and genuine,—families of fabricated MSS.,
and those which we knew to be trustworthy,—mutilated and
unmutilated Copies. Every one of what <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">you</span></em> are pleased to
call <span class="tei tei-q">‘Conflate Readings,’</span> learned sir, we found—just as you
find them—in 99 out of 100 of our copies: and we gave
them our deliberate approval, and left them standing in the
Text in consequence. We believed them to be,—we are
confident that they <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">are</span></em>,—the very words of the Evangelists

All this however by the way. The essential thing to be
borne in mind is that, according to Dr. Hort,—<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">on two distinct

XXVI. Pass <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">fifteen hundred</span></em> years, and the Reader is invited
to note attentively what has come to pass. Time has made
a clean sweep, it may be, of every Greek codex belonging to
either of the two dates above indicated. Every tradition
belonging to the period has also long since utterly perished.
When lo, in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1831, under the auspices of Dr. Lachmann,
<span class="tei tei-q">“a new departure”</span> is made. Up springs what may be called
the new German school of Textual Criticism,—of which the
fundamental principle is a superstitious deference to the
decrees of cod. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b</span></span>. The heresy prevails for fifty years (1831-81)
and obtains many adherents. The practical result is,
that its chief promoters make it their business to throw discredit
on the result of the two great Antiochian Revisions
already spoken of! The (so-called) <span class="tei tei-q">“Syrian Text”</span>—although
assumed by Drs. Westcott and Hort to be the product of the
combined wisdom, piety, and learning of the great Patriarchates
of the East from <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 250 to <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 350; <span class="tei tei-q">“a <span class="tei tei-q">‘Recension’</span>
in the proper sense of the word; a work of attempted Criticism,
performed deliberately by Editors and not merely by
Scribes”</span> (p. 133):—this <span class="tei tei-q">“Syrian Text,”</span> Doctors Westcott and
Hort denounce as <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">showing no marks of either critical or spiritual
insight:</span></em>”</span>—
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It <span class="tei tei-q">“presents”</span> (say they) <span class="tei tei-q">“the New Testament in a form
smooth and attractive, but <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">appreciably impoverished in sense and
force</span></em>; more fitted for cursory perusal or recitation than for

XXVII. We are content to leave this matter to the
Reader's judgment. For ourselves, we make no secret of
the grotesqueness of the contrast thus, for the second time,
presented to the imagination. On <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">that</span></em> side, by the hypothesis,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page288">[pg 288]</span><a name="Pg288" id="Pg288" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
sit the greatest Doctors of primitive Christendom,
assembled in solemn conclave. Every most illustrious name
is there. By ingeniously drawing a purely arbitrary hard-and-fast
line at the year <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 350, and so anticipating many
a <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">floruit</span></span>”</span> by something between five and five-and-twenty
years, Dr. Hort's intention is plain: but the expedient will
not serve his turn. Quite content are we with the names
secured to us within the proposed limits of time. On <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">that</span></em>
side then, we behold congregated choice representatives
of the wisdom, the piety, the learning of the Eastern
Church, from <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 250 to <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 350.—On this side sits—Dr.
Hort! ... An interval of 1532 years separates these
two parties.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
XXVIII. And first,—How may the former assemblage be
supposed to have been occupying themselves? The object
with which those distinguished personages came together was
the loftiest, the purest, the holiest imaginable: viz. to purge
out from the sacred Text the many corruptions by which, in
their judgments, it had become depraved during the 250 (or
at the utmost 300) years which have elapsed since it first
came into existence; to detect the counterfeit and to eliminate
the spurious. Not unaware by any means are they of the
carelessness of Scribes, nor yet of the corruptions which have
been brought in through the officiousness of critical <span class="tei tei-q">“Correctors”</span>
of the Text. To what has resulted from the misdirected
piety of the Orthodox, they are every bit as fully alive as to
what has crept in through the malignity of Heretical Teachers.
Moreover, while the memory survives in all its freshness of
the depravations which the inspired Text has experienced
from these and other similar corrupting influences, the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">means
abound</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">are at hand</span></em> of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">testing</span></em> every suspected place of
Scripture. Well, and next,—How have these holy men
prospered in their holy enterprise?
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page289">[pg 289]</span><a name="Pg289" id="Pg289" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
XXIX. According to Dr. Hort, by a strange fatality,—a
most unaccountable and truly disastrous proclivity to error,—these
illustrious Fathers of the Church have been at every
instant substituting the spurious for the genuine,—a fabricated
Text in place of the Evangelical Verity. Miserable
men! In the Gospels alone they have interpolated about
3100 words: have omitted about 700: have substituted about
1000; have transposed about 2200: have altered (in respect
of number, case, mood, tense, person, &amp;c.) about 1200.<a id="noteref_724" name="noteref_724" href="#note_724"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">724</span></span></a> This
done, they have amused themselves with the give-and-take
process of mutual accommodation which we are taught to call
<span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Conflation</span></em>:”</span> in plain terms, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">they have been manufacturing
Scripture</span></em>. The Text, as it comes forth from their hands,—
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(a) <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Shews no marks of either critical or spiritual insight:</span></em>”</span>—
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(b) <span class="tei tei-q">“Presents the New Testament in a form smooth and
attractive, but <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">appreciably impoverished in sense and force</span></em>:”</span>—
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(c) <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Is more fitted for cursory perusal or recitation, than for
repeated and diligent study.</span></em>”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Moreover, the mischief has proved infectious,—has spread.
In Syria also, at Edessa or Nisibis,—(for it is as well to be
circumstantial in such matters,)—the self-same iniquity is
about to be perpetrated; of which the Peschito will be the
abiding monument: <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">one</span></em> solitary witness only to the pure Text
being suffered to escape. Cureton's fragmentary Syriac will
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page290">[pg 290]</span><a name="Pg290" id="Pg290" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
alone remain to exhibit to mankind the outlines of primitive
Truth. (The reader is reminded of the character already
given of the document in question at the summit of page
<a href="#Pg279" class="tei tei-ref">279</a>. Its extravagance can only be fully appreciated by one
who will be at the pains to read it steadily through.)
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
XXX. And pray, (we ask,)—<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Who</span></em> says all this? <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Who</span></em> is it
who gravely puts forth all this egregious nonsense?... It is
Dr. Hort, (we answer,) at pp. 134-5 of the volume now under
review. In fact, according to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">him</span></em>, those primitive Fathers
have been the great falsifiers of Scripture; have proved the
worst enemies of the pure Word of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">God</span></span>; have shamefully
betrayed their sacred trust; have done the diametrical reverse
of what (by the hypothesis) they came together for the sole
purpose of doing. They have depraved and corrupted that
sacred Text which it was their aim, their duty, and their professed
object to purge from its errors. And (by the hypothesis)
Dr. Hort, at the end of 1532 years,—aided by codex <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b</span></span>
and his own self-evolved powers of divination,—has found
them out, and now holds them up to the contempt and scorn
of the British public.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
XXXI. In the meantime the illustrious Professor invites
us to believe that the mistaken textual judgment pronounced
at Antioch in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 350 had an immediate effect on the Text
of Scripture throughout the world. We are requested to suppose
that it resulted in the instantaneous extinction of codices
the like of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b</span></span> א, wherever found; and caused codices of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a</span></span> type
to spring up like mushrooms in their place, and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">that</span></em>, in every
library of ancient Christendom. We are further required to
assume that this extraordinary substitution of new evidence
for old—the false for the true—fully explains why Irenæus
and Hippolytus, Athanasius and Didymus, Gregory of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page291">[pg 291]</span><a name="Pg291" id="Pg291" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Nazianzus and Gregory of Nyssa, Basil and Ephraem, Epiphanius
and Chrysostom, Theodore of Mopsuestia and Isidore
of Pelusium, Nilus and Nonnus, Proclus and Severianus,
the two Cyrils and Theodoret—<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">one and all</span></em>—show themselves
strangers to the text of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b</span></span> and א.... We read and
marvel.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
XXXII. For, (it is time to enquire,)—Does not the learned
Professor see that, by thus getting rid of the testimony of
the whole body of the Fathers, he leaves the Science which he is
so good as to patronize in a most destitute condition,—besides
placing himself in a most inconvenient state of isolation? If
clear and consentient Patristic testimony to the Text of Scripture
is not to be deemed forcible witness to its Truth,—<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">whither</span></em>
shall a man betake himself for constraining Evidence?
Dr. Hort has already set aside the Traditional Text as a thing
of no manner of importance. The venerable Syriac Version
he has also insisted on reducing very nearly to the level of
the despised cursives. As for the copies of the old Latin,
they had confessedly become so untrustworthy, at the time of
which he speaks, that a modest Revision of the Text they
embody, (the <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Vulgate</span></em>”</span> namely,) became at last a measure
of necessity. What remains to him therefore? Can he
seriously suppose that the world will put up with the <span class="tei tei-q">“idiosyncrasy”</span>
of a living Doctor—his <span class="tei tei-q">“personal instincts”</span> (p. xi.)—his
<span class="tei tei-q">“personal discernment”</span> (p. 65),—his <span class="tei tei-q">“instinctive processes
of Criticism”</span> (p. 66),—his <span class="tei tei-q">“individual mind,”</span>—in preference
to articulate voices coming to us across the gulf of Time from
every part of ancient Christendom? How—with the faintest
chance of success—does Dr. Hort propose to remedy the
absence of External Testimony? If mankind can afford to
do without either consent of Copies or of Fathers, why does
mankind any longer adhere to the ancient methods of proof?
Why do Critics of every school <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">still</span></em> accumulate references to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page292">[pg 292]</span><a name="Pg292" id="Pg292" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
MSS., explore the ancient Versions, and ransack the Patristic
writings in search of neglected citations of Scripture? That
the ancients were indifferent Textual Critics, is true enough.
The mischief done by Origen in this department,—through
his fondness for a branch of Learning in which his remarks
show that he was all unskilled,—is not to be told. But then,
these men lived within a very few hundred years of the
Apostles of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord Jesus Christ</span></span>: and when they witness
to the reading of their own copies, their testimony on the point,
to say the least, is worthy of our most respectful attention.
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Dated codices,</span></em> in fact are they, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">to all intents and purposes,</span></em>
as often as they bear clear witness to the Text of Scripture:—a
fact, (we take leave to throw out the remark in passing,)
which has not yet nearly attracted the degree of attention
which it deserves.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
XXXIII. For ourselves, having said so much on this subject,
it is fair that we should add,—We devoutly wish that
Dr. Hort's hypothesis of an authoritative and deliberate Recension
of the Text of the New Testament achieved at Antioch
first, about A.D. 250, and next, about <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 350, were indeed an
historical fact. We desire no firmer basis on which to rest
our confidence in the Traditional Text of Scripture than
the deliberate verdict of Antiquity,—the ascertained sanction
of the collective Church, in the Nicene age. The <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Latin</span></em>
<span class="tei tei-q">“Vulgate”</span> [<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 385] is the work of a single man—Jerome. The
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Syriac</span></em> <span class="tei tei-q">“Vulgate”</span> [<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 616] was also the work of a single
man—Thomas of Harkel. But this <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Greek</span></em> <span class="tei tei-q">“Vulgate”</span> was (by
the hypothesis) the product of the Church Catholic, [<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 250-<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span>
350,] in her corporate capacity. Not only should we hail
such a monument of the collective piety and learning of the
Church in her best days with unmingled reverence and joy,
were it introduced to our notice; but we should insist that
no important deviation from such a <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Textus Receptus</span></span>”</span> as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">that</span></em>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page293">[pg 293]</span><a name="Pg293" id="Pg293" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
would deserve to be listened to. In other words, if Dr.
Hort's theory about the origin of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Textus Receptus</span></span> have
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">any foundation at all</span></em> in fact, it is <span class="tei tei-q">“all up”</span> with Dr. Hort.
He is absolutely <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">nowhere.</span></em> He has most ingeniously placed
himself on the horns of a fatal dilemma.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
For,—(let it be carefully noted,)—the entire discussion
becomes, in this way, brought (so to speak) within the compass
of a nutshell. To state the case briefly,—We are invited
to make our election between the Fathers of the Church,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 250 and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 350,—and Dr. Hort, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1881. The issue is
really reduced to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">that.</span></em> The general question of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">the Text of
Scripture</span></span> being the matter at stake; (not any particular

of the whole body of the Fathers? or shall we prefer to be
guided by the self-evolved imaginations of one who confessedly
has nothing to offer but conjecture? The question
before us is reduced to that single issue. But in fact the
alternative admits of being yet more concisely stated. We are
invited to make our election between <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">fact</span></span> and—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">fiction</span></span>....
All this, of course, on the supposition that there is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">any truth
at all</span></em> in Dr. Hort's <span class="tei tei-q">“New Textual Theory.”</span>

XXXIV. Apart however from the gross intrinsic improbability
of the supposed Recension,—the utter absence of
one particle of evidence, traditional or otherwise, that it ever
did take place, must be held to be fatal to the hypothesis
that it <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">did.</span></em> It is simply incredible that an incident of such
magnitude and interest would leave no trace of itself in history.
As a conjecture—(and it only professes to be a conjecture)—Dr.
Hort's notion of how the Text of the Fathers of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page294">[pg 294]</span><a name="Pg294" id="Pg294" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the IIIrd, IVth, and Vth centuries,—which, as he truly
remarks, is in the main identical with our own <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Received Text</span></em>,—came
into being, must be unconditionally abandoned. In the
words of a learned living Prelate,—<span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the supposition</span></em>”</span> on which
Drs. Westcott and Hort have staked their critical reputation,
<span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">is a manifest absurdity</span></em>.”</span><a id="noteref_725" name="noteref_725" href="#note_725"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">725</span></span></a>

XXXV. We have been so full on the subject of this imaginary
<span class="tei tei-q">“Antiochian”</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">“Syrian text,”</span> not (the reader may be
sure) without sufficient reason. Scant satisfaction truly is
there in scattering to the winds an airy tissue which its
ingenious authors have been industriously weaving for
30 years. But it is clear that with this hypothesis of a
<span class="tei tei-q">“Syrian”</span> text,—the immediate source and actual prototype of
the commonly received Text of the N. T.,—<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">stands or falls
their entire Textual theory</span></em>. Reject it, and the entire fabric is
observed to collapse, and subside into a shapeless ruin. And
with it, of necessity, goes the <span class="tei tei-q">“New Greek Text,”</span>—and therefore
the <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">New English Version</span></em>”</span> of our Revisionists, which in
the main has been founded on it.

XXXVI. In the meantime the phenomena upon which this
phantom has been based, remain unchanged; and fairly interpreted,
will be found to conduct us to the diametrically
opposite result to that which has been arrived at by Drs.
Westcott and Hort. With perfect truth has the latter
remarked on the practical <span class="tei tei-q">“identity of the Text, more especially
in the Gospels and Pauline Epistles, in all the known
cursive MSS., except a few”</span> (p. 143). We fully admit the
truth of his statement that—

about three or four, to ten or eleven centuries later, must

XXXVII. So far then, happily, we are entirely agreed. The
only question is,—How is this resemblance to be accounted
for? <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Not</span></em>, we answer,—<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">not</span></em>, certainly, by putting forward so
violent and improbable—so <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">irrational</span></em> a conjecture as that,
first, about <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 250,—and then again about <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 350,—an
authoritative standard Text was fabricated at Antioch; of
which all other known MSS. (except a very little handful)
are nothing else but transcripts:—but rather, by loyally
recognizing, in the practical identity of the Text exhibited
by 99 out of 100 of our extant MSS., the probable general
fidelity of those many transcripts <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">to the inspired exemplars
themselves from which remotely they are confessedly descended</span></em>.
And surely, if it be allowable to assume (with Dr. Hort)
that for 1532 years, (viz. from <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 350 to <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1882) the

will be impossible to assign any valid reason
why the inspired Original itself, the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Apostolic</span></em> standard,
should not have been as faithfully transmitted and retained
from the Apostolic age to the Antiochian,<a id="noteref_726" name="noteref_726" href="#note_726"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">726</span></span></a>—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> throughout

XXXVIII. Here, it will obviously occur to enquire,—But
what has been Drs. Westcott and Hort's <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">motive</span></em> for inventing
such an improbable hypothesis? and why is Dr. Hort so
strenuous in maintaining it?... We reply by reminding
the Reader of certain remarks which we made at the
outset.<a id="noteref_727" name="noteref_727" href="#note_727"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">727</span></span></a> The <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Traditional Text</span></em> of the N. T. is a phenomenon
which sorely exercises Critics of the new school. To depreciate
it, is easy: to deny its critical authority, is easier still:
to cast ridicule on the circumstances under which Erasmus
produced his first (very faulty) edition of it (1516), is easiest
of all. But <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">to ignore</span></em> the <span class="tei tei-q">“Traditional Text,”</span> is impossible.
Equally impossible is it to overlook its practical identity
with the Text of Chrysostom, who lived and taught <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">at Antioch</span></em>
till <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 398, when he became Abp. of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Constantinople</span></em>.
Now this is a very awkward circumstance, and must in some
way be got over; for it transports us, at a bound, from the
stifling atmosphere of Basle and Alcala,—from Erasmus and
Stunica, Stephens and Beza and the Elzevirs,—to Antioch
and Constantinople in the latter part of the IVth century.
What is to be done?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
XXXIX. Drs. Westcott and Hort assume that this <span class="tei tei-q">“Antiochian
text”</span>—found in the later cursives and the Fathers of
the latter half of the IVth century—must be an <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">artificial</span></em>,
an <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">arbitrarily invented</span></em> standard; a text <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">fabricated</span></em> between
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page297">[pg 297]</span><a name="Pg297" id="Pg297" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 250 and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 350. And if they may but be so fortunate
as to persuade the world to adopt their hypothesis, then all
will be easy; for they will have reduced the supposed <span class="tei tei-q">“consent
of Fathers”</span> to the reproduction of one and the same
single <span class="tei tei-q">“primary documentary witness:”</span><a id="noteref_728" name="noteref_728" href="#note_728"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">728</span></span></a>—and <span class="tei tei-q">“it is hardly
necessary to point out the total change in the bearing
of the evidence by the introduction of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the factor of Genealogy</span></em>”</span>
(p. 43) at this particular juncture. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Upset</span></em> the
hypothesis on the other hand, and all is reversed in a
moment. Every attesting Father is perceived to be a dated
MS. and an independent authority; and the combined evidence
of several of these becomes simply unmanageable.
In like manner, <span class="tei tei-q">“the approximate consent of the cursives”</span>
(see the foot-note), is perceived to be equivalent <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">not</span></em> to <span class="tei tei-q">“A
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">primary documentary witness</span></span>,”</span>—<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">not</span></em> to <span class="tei tei-q">“ONE <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Antiochian
original</span></span>,”</span>—but to be tantamount to the articulate speech of
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">many</span></em> witnesses <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">of high character</span></em>, coming to us <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">from every
quarter</span></em> of primitive Christendom.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
XL. But—(the further enquiry is sure to be made)—In
favour of which document, or set of documents, have all
these fantastic efforts been made to disparage the commonly
received standards of excellence? The ordinary English
Reader may require to be reminded that, prior to the IVth
century, our Textual helps are few, fragmentary, and—to
speak plainly—insufficient. As for sacred Codices of that
date, we possess <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">not one</span></span>. Of our two primitive Versions,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page298">[pg 298]</span><a name="Pg298" id="Pg298" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<span class="tei tei-q">“the Syriac and the old Latin,”</span> the second is grossly corrupt;
owing (says Dr. Hort) <span class="tei tei-q">“to a perilous confusion between
transcription and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">reproduction</span></em>;”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“the preservation of a
record and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">its supposed improvement</span></em>”</span> (p. 121). <span class="tei tei-q">“Further
acquaintance with it only increases our distrust”</span> (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ibid.</span></span>). In
plainer English, <span class="tei tei-q">“the earliest readings which can be fixed
chronologically”</span> (p. 120) belong to a Version which is licentious
and corrupt to an incredible extent. And though
<span class="tei tei-q">“there is no reason to doubt that the Peschito [or ancient
Syriac] is at least as old as the Latin Version”</span> (p. 84), yet
(according to Dr. Hort) it is <span class="tei tei-q">“impossible”</span>—(he is nowhere so
good as to explain to us wherein this supposed <span class="tei tei-q">“impossibility”</span>
consists),—to regard <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the present form</span></em> of the Version
as a true representation of the original Syriac text.”</span> The
date of it (according to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">him</span></em>) <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">may</span></em> be as late as <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 350.
Anyhow, we are assured (but only by Dr. Hort) that important
<span class="tei tei-q">“evidence for the Greek text is hardly to be looked for
from <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">this</span></em> source”</span> (p. 85).—The Fathers of the IIIrd century
who have left behind them considerable remains in Greek
are but two,—Clemens Alex. and Origen: and there are
considerations attending the citations of either, which greatly
detract from their value.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
XLI. The question therefore recurs with redoubled emphasis,—In
favour of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">which</span></em> document, or set of documents,
does Dr. Hort disparage the more considerable portion of
that early evidence,—so much of it, namely, as belongs to
the IVth century,—on which the Church has been hitherto

IVth century”</span> (p. 146) is undeserving of our confidence:—if
we are to believe that a systematic depravation of Scripture
was universally going on till about the end of the IIIrd
century; and if at that time, an authoritative and deliberate
recension of it—conducted on utterly erroneous principles—took
place at Antioch, and resulted in the vicious <span class="tei tei-q">“traditional
Constantinopolitan”</span> (p. 143), or (as Dr. Hort prefers
to call it) the <span class="tei tei-q">“eclectic Syrian Text:”</span>—<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">What remains to us</span></em>?
Are we henceforth to rely on our own <span class="tei tei-q">“inner consciousness”</span>
for illumination? Or is it seriously expected that for the
restoration of the inspired Verity we shall be content to
surrender ourselves blindfold to the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">ipse dixit</span></span> of an unknown

pronounced of—codex <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b</span></span>. One is reminded of an enegmatical

XLVII. But how does it happen—(we must needs repeat
the enquiry, which however we make with unfeigned
astonishment,)—How does it come to pass that a man of
practised intellect, addressing persons as cultivated and perhaps
as acute as himself, can handle a confessedly obscure
problem like the present after this strangely incoherent, this
foolish and wholly inconclusive fashion? One would have
supposed that Dr. Hort's mathematical training would have
made him an exact reasoner. But he writes as if he had no
idea at all of the nature of demonstration, and of the process
necessary in order to carry conviction home to a Reader's
mind. Surely, (one tells oneself,) a minimum of <span class="tei tei-q">“pass”</span> Logic
would have effectually protected so accomplished a gentleman
from making such a damaging exhibition of himself!
For surely he must be aware that, as yet, he has produced
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">not one particle of evidence</span></em> that his opinion concerning <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b</span></span> and א
is well founded. And yet, how can he possibly overlook the
circumstance that, unless he is able to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">demonstrate</span></em> that
those two codices, and especially the former of them, has
<span class="tei tei-q">“preserved not only a very ancient Text, but <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">a very pure line
of ancient Text</span></em>”</span> also (p. 251), his entire work, (inasmuch as it
reposes on that one assumption,) on being critically handled,
crumbles to its base; or rather melts into thin air before the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page306">[pg 306]</span><a name="Pg306" id="Pg306" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
first puff of wind? He cannot, surely, require telling that
those who look for Demonstration will refuse to put up with
Rhetoric:—that, with no thoughtful person will Assertion
pass for Argument:—nor mere Reiteration, however long
persevered in, ever be mistaken for accumulated Proof.

device thus indicated proves to be not peculiar to Professors
of the University of Oxford; but to be familiarly recognized
as an instrument of conviction by the learned men who dwell
on the banks of the Cam. To be serious however.—Dr. Hort
has evidently failed to see that nothing short of a careful
induction of particular instances,—a system of laborious
footnotes, or an <span class="tei tei-q">“Appendix”</span> bristling with impregnable facts,—could
sustain the portentous weight of his fundamental

It is related of the illustrious architect, Sir Gilbert Scott,—when
he had to rebuild the massive central tower of a
southern Cathedral, and to rear up thereon a lofty spire of
stone,—that he made preparations for the work which
astonished the Dean and Chapter of the day. He caused
the entire area to be excavated to what seemed a most
unnecessary depth, and proceeded to lay a bed of concrete of
fabulous solidity. The <span class="tei tei-q">“wise master-builder”</span> was determined
that his work should last for ever. Not so Drs. Westcott
and Hort. They are either troubled with no similar anxieties,
or else too clear-sighted to cherish any similar hope. They
are evidently of opinion that a cloud or a quagmire will serve

Dr. Hort (as we have seen already, namely in p. 252,)
considers that his individual <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">strong preference</span></span>”</span> of one
set of Readings above another, is sufficient to determine
whether the Manuscript which contains those Readings is

wholly inadmissible. It practically dispenses with Critical
aids altogether; substituting individual caprice for external

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As for the proposed test of Truth,—(the enquiry, namely,
whether or no a reading has <span class="tei tei-q">“the ring of genuineness”</span>)—it is
founded on a transparent mistake. The coarse operation
alluded to may be described as a <span class="tei tei-q">“rough and ready”</span>
expedient practised by <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">receivers of money</span></em> in the way of self-defence,
and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">only</span></em> for their own protection, lest base metal
should be palmed off upon them unawares. But Dr. Hort
is proposing an analogous test for the exclusive satisfaction
of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">him who utters</span></em> the suspected article. We therefore disallow
the proposal entirely: not, of course, because we
suppose that so excellent and honourable a man as Dr. Hort
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page309">[pg 309]</span><a name="Pg309" id="Pg309" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
would attempt to pass off as genuine what he suspects to
be fabricated; but because we are fully convinced—(for
reasons <span class="tei tei-q">“plenty as blackberries”</span>)—that through some natural
defect, or constitutional inaptitude, he is not a competent
judge. The man who finds <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">no marks of either Critical or

that <span class="tei tei-q">“the text of Chrysostom and other Syrian Fathers of

separately, S. Mark's last 12 verses, (on the plea that they
<span class="tei tei-q">“manifestly cannot claim any apostolic authority; but are

effectually put himself out of Court. He has convicted
himself of a natural infirmity of judgment,—has given proof
that he labours under a peculiar Critical inaptitude for this
department of enquiry,—which renders his decrees nugatory,
and his opinions worthless.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
L. But apart from all this, the Reader's attention is invited
to a little circumstance which Dr. Hort has unaccountably
overlooked: but which, the instant it has been stated, is
observed to cause his picturesque theory to melt away—like
a snow-wreath in the sunshine.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
On reflexion, it will be perceived that the most signal
deformities of codices <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b</span></span> א <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">d l</span></span> are <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">instances of Omission</span></em>. In
the Gospels alone, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b</span></span> omits 2877 words.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
How,—(we beg to enquire,)—How will you apply your
proposed test to a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Non-entity</span></em>? How will you ascertain
whether something which <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">does not exist in the Text</span></em> has <span class="tei tei-q">“the
ring of genuineness”</span> or not? There can be <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">no</span></em> <span class="tei tei-q">“ring of
genuineness,”</span> clearly, where there is nothing to ring with!
Will any one pretend that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the omission</span></em> of the incident of the
troubling of the pool has in it any <span class="tei tei-q">“ring of genuineness”</span>?—or
dare to assert that <span class="tei tei-q">“the ring of genuineness”</span> is imparted
to the history of our <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Saviour's</span></span> Passion, by the omission of
His Agony in the Garden?—or that the narrative of His
Crucifixion becomes more musical, when our Lord's Prayer
for His murderers has been <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">omitted</span></em>?—or that ἐφοβοῦντο γάρ
(<span class="tei tei-q">“for they were afraid”</span>), has <span class="tei tei-q">“the ring of genuineness”</span> as the
conclusion of the last chapter of the Gospel according to
S. Mark?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But the strangest circumstance is behind. It is notorious
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page311">[pg 311]</span><a name="Pg311" id="Pg311" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
that, on the contrary, Dr. Hort is frequently constrained
to admit that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the omitted words</span></em> actually <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">have</span></em> <span class="tei tei-q">“the ring of
genuineness.”</span> The words which he insists on thrusting out
of the Text are often conspicuous <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">for the very quality</span></em> which
(by the hypothesis) was the warrant for their exclusion. Of
this, the Reader may convince himself by referring to the
note at foot of the present page.<a id="noteref_739" name="noteref_739" href="#note_739"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">739</span></span></a> In the meantime, the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page312">[pg 312]</span><a name="Pg312" id="Pg312" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
matter discoursed of may be conveniently illustrated by a
short apologue:—
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Somewhere in the fens of Ely diocese, stood a crazy old
church (dedicated to S. Bee, of course,) the bells of which—according
to a learned Cambridge Doctor—were the most
musical in the world. <span class="tei tei-q">“I have listened to those bells,”</span> (he
was accustomed to say,) <span class="tei tei-q">“for 30 years. All other bells are
cracked, harsh, out of tune. Commend me, for music, to the
bells of S. Bee's! <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">They</span></em> alone have <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the ring of genuineness</span></em>.”</span>
... Accordingly, he published a treatise on Campanology,
founding his theory on the musical properties of the bells of
S. Bee's.—At this juncture, provokingly enough, some one
directed attention to the singular fact that S. Bee's is one
of the few churches in that district <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">without</span></em> bells: a discovery
which, it is needless to add, pressed inconveniently on the
learned Doctor's theory.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
LI. But enough of this. We really have at last, (be it
observed,) reached the end of our enquiry. Nothing comes
after Dr. Hort's extravagant and unsupported estimate of
Codices <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b</span></span> and א. On the contrary. Those two documents
are caused to cast their sombre shadows a long way ahead,
and to darken all our future. Dr. Hort takes leave of the
subject with the announcement that, whatever uncertainty
may attach to the evidence for particular readings,

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">The general course of future Criticism must be shaped by the
happy circumstance that the fourth century has bequeathed to us two
MSS.</span></em> [<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b</span></span> and א], of which even the less incorrupt [א] must have
been of exceptional purity among its contemporaries: and
which rise into greater pre-eminence of character the better
the early history of the Text becomes known.”</span>—(p. 287.)

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In other words, our guide assures us that in a dutiful submission
to codices <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b</span></span> and א,—(which, he naïvely remarks,

Testament”</span> [p. 212],)—lies all our hope of future progress.
(Just as if we should ever have <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">heard</span></em> of these two codices,
had their contents come down to us written in the ordinary
cursive character,—in a dated MS. (suppose) of the XVth
century!)... Moreover, Dr. Hort <span class="tei tei-q">“must not hesitate to
express”</span> his own robust conviction,

up within those limits!... An uneasy suspicion however
secretly suggests itself that perhaps, as the years roll out,
something may come to light which will effectually dispel
every dream of the new School, and reduce even prejudice
itself to silence. So Dr. Hort hastens to frown it down:—

And yet, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">why</span></em> the anticipation of important help from the
acquisition of fresh documentary Evidence <span class="tei tei-q">“would be an

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
LIII. To conclude. We have already listened to Dr. Hort
long enough. And now, since confessedly, a chain is no
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page315">[pg 315]</span><a name="Pg315" id="Pg315" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
stronger than it is at its weakest link; nor an edifice more
secure than the basis whereon it stands;—we must be allowed
to point out that we have been dealing throughout with a
dream, pure and simple; from which it is high time that we
should wake up, now that we have been plainly shown on
what an unsubstantial foundation these Editors have been all
along building. A child's house, several stories high, constructed
out of playing-cards,—is no unapt image of the
frail erection before us. We began by carefully lifting off
the topmost story; and then, the next: but we might as well
have saved ourselves the trouble. The basement-story has
to be removed bodily, which must bring the whole edifice
down with a rush. In reply to the fantastic tissue of unproved
assertions which go before, we assert as follows:—
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(1) The impurity of the Texts exhibited by Codices <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b</span></span> and
א is not a matter of opinion, but a matter of fact.<a id="noteref_740" name="noteref_740" href="#note_740"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">740</span></span></a> These are
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page316">[pg 316]</span><a name="Pg316" id="Pg316" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
two of the least trustworthy documents in existence. So far
from allowing Dr. Hort's position that—<span class="tei tei-q">“A Text formed”</span> by
<span class="tei tei-q">“taking Codex <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b</span></span> as the sole authority,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“would be incomparably
nearer the Truth than a Text similarly taken from
any other Greek or other single document”</span> (p. 251),—we
venture to assert that it would be, on the contrary, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">by far
the foulest Text that had ever seen the light</span></em>: worse, that is
to say, even than the Text of Drs. Westcott and Hort. And
that is saying a great deal. In the brave and faithful words
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page317">[pg 317]</span><a name="Pg317" id="Pg317" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of Prebendary Scrivener (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Introduction</span></span>, p. 453),—words which
deserve to become famous,—
</p>

<div class="block tei tei-quote" style="margin-bottom: 1.80em; margin-left: 3.60em; margin-top: 1.80em; margin-right: 3.60em">
<span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">It is no less true to fact than paradoxical in sound, that the
worst corruptions to which the New Testament has ever been
subjected, originated within a hundred years after it was composed:
that Irenæus [</span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%"> 150], and the African Fathers, and
the whole Western, with a portion of the Syrian Church, used
far inferior manuscripts to those employed by Stunica, or
Erasmus, or Stephens thirteen centuries later, when moulding
the Textus Receptus.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span>
</div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And Codices <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b</span></span> and א are, demonstrably, nothing else but
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">specimens of the depraved class thus characterized</span></em>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Next—(2), We assert that, so manifest are the disfigurements
jointly and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">exclusively</span></em> exhibited by codices <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b</span></span> and א,<a id="noteref_741" name="noteref_741" href="#note_741"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">741</span></span></a>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page318">[pg 318]</span><a name="Pg318" id="Pg318" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
that instead of accepting these codices as two <span class="tei tei-q">“independent”</span>
Witnesses to the inspired Original, we are constrained to
regard them as little more than a single reproduction of one
and the same scandalously corrupt and (<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">comparatively</span></em>) late
Copy. By consequence, we consider their joint and exclusive
attestation of any particular reading, <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">an unique criterion</span></em>”</span>
of its worthlessness; a sufficient reason—<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">not</span></em> for adopting,
but—for unceremoniously rejecting it.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Then—(3), As for the origin of these two curiosities, it can
perforce only be divined from their contents. That they
exhibit fabricated Texts is demonstrable. No amount of
honest <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">copying</span></em>,—persevered in for any number of centuries,—could
by possibility have resulted in two such documents.
Separated from one another in actual date by 50, perhaps by
100 years,<a id="noteref_742" name="noteref_742" href="#note_742"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">742</span></span></a> they must needs have branched off from a
common corrupt ancestor, and straightway become exposed
continuously to fresh depraving influences. The result is,
that codex א, (which evidently has gone through more adventures
and fallen into worse company than his rival,) has
been corrupted to a far graver extent than codex <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b</span></span>, and is
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page319">[pg 319]</span><a name="Pg319" id="Pg319" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
even more untrustworthy. Thus, whereas (in the Gospels
alone) <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b</span></span> has 589 Readings <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">quite peculiar to itself</span></em>, affecting
858 words,—א has 1460 such Readings, affecting 2640 words.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
One <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">solid fact</span></em> like the preceding, (let it be pointed out
in passing,) is more helpful by far to one who would form
a correct estimate of the value of a Codex, than any number
of such <span class="tei tei-q">“reckless and unverified assertions,”</span> not to say
peremptory and baseless decrees, as abound in the highly
imaginative pages of Drs. Westcott and Hort.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(4) Lastly,—We suspect that these two Manuscripts are
indebted for their preservation, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">solely to their ascertained evil
character</span></em>; which has occasioned that the one eventually
found its way, four centuries ago, to a forgotten shelf in the
Vatican library: while the other, after exercising the ingenuity
of several generations of critical Correctors, eventually
(viz. in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1844<a id="noteref_743" name="noteref_743" href="#note_743"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">743</span></span></a>) got deposited in the waste-paper basket
of the Convent at the foot of Mount Sinai. Had <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b</span></span> and א
been copies of average purity, they must long since have
shared the inevitable fate of books which are freely <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">used</span></em> and
highly prized; namely, they would have fallen into decadence
and disappeared from sight. But in the meantime, behold,
their very Antiquity has come to be reckoned to their advantage;
and (strange to relate) is even considered to constitute
a sufficient reason why they should enjoy not merely extraordinary
consideration, but the actual surrender of the
critical judgment. Since 1831, Editors have vied with one
another in the fulsomeness of the homage they have paid to
these <span class="tei tei-q">“two false Witnesses,”</span>—for such <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b</span></span> and א <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">are</span></em>, as the
concurrent testimony of Copies, Fathers and Versions abundantly
proves. Even superstitious reverence has been claimed
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page320">[pg 320]</span><a name="Pg320" id="Pg320" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
for these two codices: and Drs. Westcott and Hort are so far
in advance of their predecessors in the servility of their
blind adulation, that they must be allowed to have easily
won the race.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
LIV. With this,—so far as the Greek Text under review is
concerned,—we might, were we so minded, reasonably make
an end. We undertook to show that Drs. Westcott and
Hort, in the volumes before us, have built up an utterly
worthless Textual fabric; and we consider that we have
already sufficiently shown it. The Theory,—the Hypothesis
rather, on which their Text is founded, we have <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">demonstrated</span></em>
to be <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">simply absurd</span></em>. Remove that hypothesis, and a heap
of unsightly ruins is all that is left behind,—except indeed
astonishment (not unmingled with concern) at the simplicity
of its accomplished Authors.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Here then, we might leave off. But we are unwilling
so to leave the matter. Large consideration is due to
ordinary English Readers; who must perforce look on with
utter perplexity—not to say distress—at the strange spectacle
presented by <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">that</span></em> Text (which is in the main <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the Text of the
Revised English Version</span></em>) on the one hand,—and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">this</span></em> Review
of it, on the other:—
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(1) <span class="tei tei-q">“And pray, which of you am I to believe?”</span>—will
inevitably be, in homely English, the exclamation with which
not a few will lay down the present number of the <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Quarterly</span></span>.”</span>
<span class="tei tei-q">“I pretend to no learning. I am not prepared to
argue the question with you. But surely, the oldest Manuscript
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">must</span></em> be the purest! It even stands to reason: does
it not?—Then further, I admit that you <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">seem</span></em> to have the
best of the argument so far; yet, since the three most famous
Editors of modern times are against you,—Lachmann,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page321">[pg 321]</span><a name="Pg321" id="Pg321" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Tregelles, Tischendorf,—excuse me if I suspect that you
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">must</span></em> be in the wrong, after all.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
LV. With unfeigned humility, the Reviewer [<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Q. R.</span></span>] proceeds
to explain the matter to his supposed Objector [<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">S. O.</span></span>],
in briefest outline, as follows:—
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Q. R.</span></span> <span class="tei tei-q">“You are perfectly right. The oldest Manuscript
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">must</span></em> exhibit the purest text: <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">must</span></em> be the most trustworthy.
But then, unfortunately, it happens that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">we do not possess it</span></em>.
<span class="tei tei-q">‘The oldest Manuscript’</span> is lost. You speak, of course, of
the inspired Autographs. These, I say, have long since
disappeared.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(2) <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">S. O.</span></span> <span class="tei tei-q">“No, I meant to say that the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">oldest Manuscript
we possess</span></em>, if it be but a very ancient one, must needs be
the purest.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Q. R.</span></span> <span class="tei tei-q">“O, but <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">that</span></em> is an entirely different proposition. Well,
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">apart from experience</span></em>, the probability that the oldest copy
extant will prove the purest is, if you please, considerable.
Reflection will convince you however that it is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">but</span></em> a probability,
at the utmost: a probability based upon more than
one false assumption,—with which nevertheless you shall not
be troubled. But in fact it clearly does not by any means
follow that, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">because</span></em> a MS. is very ancient, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">therefore</span></em> the Text,
which it exhibits will be very pure. That you may be
thoroughly convinced of this,—(and it is really impossible
for your mind to be too effectually disabused of a prepossession
which has fatally misled so many,)—you are invited to
enquire for a recent contribution to the learned French
publication indicated at the foot of this page,<a id="noteref_744" name="noteref_744" href="#note_744"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">744</span></span></a> in which is

copy, the verses, you will find, have been penned with
scandalous, with incredible inaccuracy. But on this head let
the learned Editor of the document in question be listened to,
rather than the present Reviewer:—</span>

inviting attention to four well-known families of falsified
manuscripts of the Sacred Writings;—complaining of the
hopeless divergences which they exhibit (being not only
inconsistent with one another, but <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">with themselves</span></em>);—and
insisting that such <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">corrected</span></em>, are nothing else but shamefully
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">corrupted</span></em> copies. He speaks of the phenomenon as being in
his day notorious: and appeals to Recensions, the very names
of whose authors—Theodotus, Asclepiades, Hermophilus,
Apollonides—have (all but the first) long since died out of
the Church's memory. You will allow therefore, (will you
not?), that by this time the claim of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">oldest existing copies</span></em>
of Scripture to be the purest, has been effectually disposed of.
For since there once prevailed such a multitude of corrupted
copies, we have no security whatever that the oldest of our
extant MSS. are not derived—remotely if not directly—from
some of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">them</span></em>.”</span>

am (to speak plainly) at a loss to understand how any man

craven homage which the foremost of the three habitually

describe as a weak superstition. It is something more than unreasonable.
It becomes even ridiculous.—Tischendorf's preference

Tregelles) regard as oracular the solitary unsupported dicta
of a Writer,—provided only he can claim to have lived in
the IInd or IIIrd century. To myself it occasions no
sort of inconvenience. You are to be told that the exorbitances

is preposterous. It is not allowable to infer the universal
from the particular. If the bones of Goliath were to be
discovered to-morrow, would you propose as an induction
therefrom that it was the fashion to wear four-and-twenty
fingers and toes on one's hands and feet in the days of the
giant of Gath? All the wild readings of the lost Codex
before us may be unceremoniously dismissed. The critical
importance and value of this stray leaf from a long-since-vanished

early transcripts of the Gospel. First, heretical assailants of
Christianity,—then, orthodox defenders of the Truth,—lastly
and above all, self-constituted Critics, who (like
Dr. Hort) imagined themselves at liberty to resort to
<span class="tei tei-q">‘instinctive processes’</span> of Criticism; and who, at first as

were actively at work throughout the first hundred and fifty

indeed through the Church's faithfulness, because,—(the
good Providence of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">God</span></span> had so willed it,)—the perpetual
multiplication, in every quarter, of copies required for
Ecclesiastical use,—not to say the solicitude of faithful men

a sufficient safeguard against the grosser forms of
corruption. But this was not all.</span>

would be protected all down the ages against depraving
influences of whatever sort,—was not to have been expected;
certainly, was never promised. But the Church, in her
collective capacity, hath nevertheless—as a matter of fact—been
perpetually purging herself of those shamefully depraved
copies which once everywhere abounded within her
pale: retaining only such an amount of discrepancy in her
Text as might serve to remind her children that they carry
their <span class="tei tei-q">‘treasure in earthen vessels,’</span>—as well as to stimulate
them to perpetual watchfulness and solicitude for the purity
and integrity of the Deposit. Never, however, up to the

industriously multiplied, that in a diocese consisting of 800

no less than 200 copies of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Diatessaron</span></span> of Tatian the
heretic,—(Tatian's date being <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 173,)—honourably preserved

Clemens moreover would seem to have been a trifle too
familiar with the works of Basilides, Marcion, Valentinus,
Heracleon, and the rest of the Gnostic crew. He habitually
mistakes apocryphal writings for inspired Scripture:<a id="noteref_763" name="noteref_763" href="#note_763"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">763</span></span></a> and—with
corrupted copies always at hand and before him—he
is just the man to present us with a quotation like the
present, and straightway to volunteer the assurance that he
found it <span class="tei tei-q">‘so written in the Gospel according to S. Mark.’</span><a id="noteref_764" name="noteref_764" href="#note_764"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">764</span></span></a>

adulteration largely from the same pestilential source
which must have corrupted the copies with which Clement
(and his pupil Origen after him) were most familiar.—And
thus you have explained to you the reason of the disgust and
indignation with which I behold in these last days a resolute
attempt made to revive and to palm off upon an unlearned

from a neglected shelf in the Vatican,—rescued from destruction
by a chance visitor to Mount Sinai.”</span>

LVIII. <span class="tei tei-q">“On first seriously applying ourselves to these
studies, many years ago, we found it wondrous difficult to
divest ourselves of prepossessions very like your own. Turn
which way we would, we were encountered by the same
confident terminology:—<span class="tei tei-q">‘the best documents,’</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">‘primary
manuscripts,’</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">‘first-rate authorities,’</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">‘primitive evidence,’</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">‘ancient

It was not until we had laboriously collated these documents
(including א) for ourselves, that we became aware of their
true character. Long before coming to the end of our task
(and it occupied us, off and on, for eight years) we had
become convinced that the supposed <span class="tei tei-q">‘best documents’</span> and
<span class="tei tei-q">‘first-rate authorities’</span> are in reality among <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the worst</span></em>:—that
these Copies deserve to be called <span class="tei tei-q">‘primary,’</span> only because in
any enumeration of manuscripts, they stand foremost;—and
that their <span class="tei tei-q">‘Evidence,’</span> whether <span class="tei tei-q">‘primitive’</span> or not, is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">contradictory</span></em>

<span class="tei tei-q">“A diligent inspection of a vast number of later Copies
scattered throughout the principal libraries of Europe, and
the exact Collation of a few, further convinced us that the
deference generally claimed for <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b</span></span>, א, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">c</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">d</span></span> is nothing else but
a weak superstition and a vulgar error:—that the date of a
MS. is not of its essence, but is a mere accident of the
problem:—and that later Copies, so far from <span class="tei tei-q">‘crumbling
down salient points, softening irregularities, conforming
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page338">[pg 338]</span><a name="Pg338" id="Pg338" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
differences,’</span><a id="noteref_765" name="noteref_765" href="#note_765"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">765</span></span></a> and so forth,—on countless occasions, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">and as a
rule</span></em>,—preserve those delicate lineaments and minute refinements
which the <span class="tei tei-q">‘old uncials’</span> are constantly observed to
obliterate. And so, rising to a systematic survey of the
entire field of Evidence, we found reason to suspect more and
more the soundness of the conclusions at which Lachmann,
Tregelles, and Tischendorf had arrived: while we seemed
led, as if by the hand, to discern plain indications of the
existence for ourselves of a far <span class="tei tei-q">‘more excellent way.’</span></span>

which Divine Wisdom hath made for the effectual conservation
of that crowning master-piece of His own creative skill,—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">The
Written Word</span></span>,—be duly considered; and surely a
recoil is inevitable from the strange perversity which in
these last days would shut us up within the limits of a very
few documents to the neglect of all the rest,—as though a
revelation from Heaven had proclaimed that the Truth is to
be found exclusively in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">them</span></em>. The good Providence of the
Author of Scripture is discovered to have furnished His
household, the Church, with (speaking roughly) 1000 copies
of the Gospels:—with twenty Versions—two of which go
back to the beginning of Christianity: and with the writings
of a host of ancient Fathers. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Why</span></em> out of those 1000 MSS.
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">two</span></em> should be singled out by Drs. Westcott and Hort for
special favour,—to the practical disregard of all the rest:
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">why</span></em> Versions and Fathers should by them be similarly dealt
with,—should be practically set aside in fact in the lump,—we
fail to discover. Certainly the pleas urged by the learned

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page339">[pg 339]</span><a name="Pg339" id="Pg339" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
it conducts us throughout to directly opposite results. We
hold it to be even axiomatic that a Reading which is supported
by only one document,—out of the 1100 (more or
less) already specified,—whether that solitary unit be a
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Father</span></span>, a <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Version</span></span>, or a <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Copy</span></span>,—stands self-condemned;
may be dismissed at once, without concern or enquiry.</span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Nor is the case materially altered if (as generally happens)
a few colleagues of bad character are observed to side with
the else solitary document. Associated with the corrupt <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b</span></span>,
is often found the more corrupt א. Nay, six leaves of א are
confidently declared by Tischendorf to have been written by
the scribe of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b</span></span>. The sympathy between these two, and the
Version of Lower Egypt, is even notorious. That Origen
should sometimes join the conspiracy,—and that the same
Reading should find allies in certain copies of the unrevised
Latin, or perhaps in Cureton's Syriac:—all <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">this</span></em> we deem the
reverse of encouraging. The attesting witnesses are, in our
account, of so suspicious a character, that the Reading cannot
be allowed. On such occasions, we are reminded that there
is truth in Dr. Hort's dictum concerning the importance
of noting the tendency of certain documents to fall into
<span class="tei tei-q">‘groups:’</span> though his assertion that <span class="tei tei-q">‘it cannot be too often

LXI. <span class="tei tei-q">“So far negatively.—A safer, the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">only</span></em> trustworthy
method, in fact, of ascertaining the Truth of Scripture, we hold
to be the method which,—without prejudice or partiality,—simply
ascertains <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">which form of the text enjoys the
earliest, the fullest, the widest, the most respectable,
and</span></span>—above all things—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">the most varied attestation</span></span>. That
a Reading should be freely recognized alike by the earliest
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page340">[pg 340]</span><a name="Pg340" id="Pg340" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and by the latest available evidence,—we hold to be a prime
circumstance in its favour. That Copies, Versions, and Fathers,
should all three concur in sanctioning it,—we hold to be even
more conclusive. If several Fathers, living in different parts
of ancient Christendom, are all observed to recognize the
words, or to quote them in the same way,—we have met with
all the additional confirmation we ordinarily require. Let
it only be further discoverable <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">how</span></em> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">why</span></em> the rival Reading
came into existence, and our confidence becomes absolute.</span>

of what goes before. Our <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord's</span></span> <span class="tei tei-q">‘Agony and bloody

in remote parts of ancient Christendom. Whether therefore
Antiquity,—Variety of testimony,—Respectability of
witnesses,—or Number,—is considered, the evidence in
favour of S. Luke xxii. 43, 44 is simply overwhelming.
And yet out of superstitious deference to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">two</span></em> Copies of
bad character, Drs. Westcott and Hort (followed by the

Minor, Cyprus, Crete, Gaul,)—come back to attest that the
traditional reading (as usual) is the true one. Yet such is
the infatuation of the new school, that Drs. Westcott and
Hort are content to make <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">nonsense</span></em> of the Angelic Hymn on
the night of the Nativity, rather than admit the possibility
of complicity in error in א <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b d</span></span>: error in respect of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">a single

LXIV. <span class="tei tei-q">“It will be perceived therefore that the method
we plead for consists merely in a loyal recognition of the whole
of the Evidence: setting off one authority against another,
laboriously and impartially; and adjudicating fairly between
them <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">all</span></em>. Even so hopelessly corrupt a document as Clement
of Alexandria's copy of the Gospels proves to have been—(described
at pp. <a href="#Pg326" class="tei tei-ref">326-31</a>)—is by no means without critical
value. Servilely followed, it would confessedly land us in
hopeless error: but, judiciously employed, as a set-off against

modern Critics;—that venerable document, with all its faults,
proves invaluable. Thus, in spite of its own aberrations, it

<span class="tei tei-q">“We deem this laborious method the only true method,
in our present state of imperfect knowledge: the method,
namely, of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">adopting that Reading which has the fullest, the

of Witnesses,</span></em> are thus secured. How men can persuade
themselves that 19 Copies out of every 20 may
be safely disregarded, if they be but written in minuscule
characters,—we fail to understand. To ourselves it seems
simply an irrational proceeding. But indeed we hold this to
be no <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">seeming</span></em> truth. The fact is absolutely demonstrable.
As for building up a Text, (as Drs. Westcott and Hort have
done,) with special superstitious deference to a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">single codex,</span></em>—we
deem it about as reasonable as would be the attempt to

we find we have reached the point to which all that went
before has been evidently converging: but we make the further
awkward discovery that it is the point on which all that

Truth of Scripture has run a very narrow risk of being lost
for ever to mankind. Dr. Hort contends that it more than
half lay <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">perdu</span></span> on a forgotten shelf in the Vatican Library;—Dr.
Tischendorf, that it had been deposited in a waste-paper

Sinai,—from which he rescued it on the 4th February, 1859:—neither,
we venture to think, a very likely circumstance.

by any means shown Himself so unmindful of the safety of
the Deposit, as these distinguished gentlemen imagine.

matter, we should for our own parts have been perfectly well
content to pass it by without a syllable of comment. So long
as nothing more is endangered than the personal reputation of
a couple of Scholars—at home or abroad—we can afford to
look on with indifference. Their private ventures are their
private concern. What excites our indignation is the spectacle
of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Church of England</span></em> becoming to some extent
involved in their discomfiture, because implicated in their
mistakes: dragged through the mire, to speak plainly, at the
chariot-wheels of these two infelicitous Doctors, and exposed
with them to the ridicule of educated Christendom. Our
Church has boasted till now of learned sons in abundance
within her pale, ready at a moment's notice to do her right:
to expose shallow sciolism, and to vindicate that precious
thing which hath been committed to her trust.<a id="noteref_773" name="noteref_773" href="#note_773"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">773</span></span></a> Where are

even taken into partnership with themselves one who openly
denies the eternal Godhead of our <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord Jesus Christ</span></span>,—in
order, as it would seem, to give proof to the world of the low

sunk among us?

sufferers after all by this ill-advised proceeding, are the

O but, the evidence in favour of Codex <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a</span></span> thickens apace!
Suppose then,—(for, after this admission, the supposition is
at least allowable,)—suppose the discovery were made tomorrow

Textual matters! How impossible would it be, henceforth,
for <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b</span></span> and its henchman א, to obtain so much as a hearing!
Such <span class="tei tei-q">“an eleven”</span> would safely defy the world! And yet,
according to Dr. Hort, the supposition may any day become
a fact; for he informs us,—(and we are glad to be able for
once to declare that what he says is perfectly correct,)—that
such manuscripts once abounded or rather <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">prevailed;</span></em>—<span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">were
commonest</span></em> in the IVth century,”</span> when codices <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b</span></span> and א

prevailed universally, in the proportion of 99 to 1.

</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
May we venture to point out, that it is easier still to
denounce adverse Criticism in the lump, instead of trying to
refute it in any one particular:—to refer vaguely to <span class="tei tei-q">“established
principles of Textual Criticism,”</span> instead of stating
which they be:—to sneer contemptuously at endeavours,
(which, even if unsuccessful, one is apt to suppose are
entitled to sympathy at the hands of a successor of the
Apostles,) instead of showing <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">wherein</span></em> such efforts are reprehensible?
We are content to put the following question to
any fair-minded man:—Whether of these two is the more
facile and culpable proceeding;—(1) <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Lightly to blot out an
inspired word from the Book of Life, and to impose a wrong
sense on Scripture</span></em>, as in this place the Bishop and his colleagues
are found to have done:—or, (2) To fetch the same
word industriously back: to establish its meaning by
diligent and laborious enquiry: to restore both to their
rightful honours: and to set them on a basis of (<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">hitherto
unobserved</span></em>) evidence, from which (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">faxit DEUS!</span></span>) it will be
found impossible henceforth to dislodge them?

one of the <span class="tei tei-q">“now established principles of Textual Criticism,”</span>

LXXIII. The Nemesis of Superstition and Idolatry is ever
the same. Phantoms of the imagination henceforth usurp the
place of substantial forms. Interminable doubt,—wretched
misbelief,—childish credulity,—judicial blindness,—are the
inevitable sequel and penalty. The mind that has long
allowed itself in a systematic trifling with Evidence, is
observed to fall the easiest prey to Imposture. It has doubted
what is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">demonstrably</span></em> true: has rejected what is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">indubitably</span></em>
Divine. Henceforth, it is observed to mistake its own
fantastic creations for historical facts: to believe things
which rest on insufficient evidence, or on no evidence at all.
Thus, these learned Professors,—who condemn the <span class="tei tei-q">“last
Twelve Verses of the Gospel according to S. Mark;”</span> which
have been accounted veritable Scripture by the Church Universal
for more than 1800 years;—nevertheless accept as
the genuine <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Diatessaron of Tatian</span></span>”</span> [<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 170], a production
which was discovered yesterday, and which <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">does not even claim
to be</span></em> the work of that primitive writer.<a id="noteref_788" name="noteref_788" href="#note_788"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">788</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Yes, the Nemesis of Superstition and Idolatry is ever the
same. General mistrust of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">all</span></em> evidence is the sure result.
In 1870, Drs. Westcott and Hort solemnly assured their
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page351">[pg 351]</span><a name="Pg351" id="Pg351" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
brother-Revisionists that <span class="tei tei-q">“the prevalent assumption that

among recorded Readings, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">does not stand the test of experience</span></em>.”</span>
They are evidently still haunted by the same spectral suspicion.
They invent a ghost to be exorcised in every dark
corner. Accordingly, Dr. Hort favours us with a chapter on
the Art of <span class="tei tei-q">“removing Corruptions of the sacred Text <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">antecedent
to extant documents</span></em>”</span> (p. 71). We are not surprised
(though we <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">are</span></em> a little amused) to hear that,—
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“The <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Art of Conjectural Emendation</span></em> depends for its success
so much on personal endowments, fertility of resource in the

delicate to acquiesce in merely plausible corrections, that it is
easy to forget its true character as a critical operation founded
on knowledge and method.”</span>—(p. 71.)

LXXIV. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Very</span></em> <span class="tei tei-q">“easy,”</span> certainly. One sample of Dr. Hort's
skill in this department, (it occurs at page 135 of his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Notes
on Select Readings</span></span>,) shall be cited in illustration. We venture
to commend it to the attention of our Readers:—
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(a) S. Paul [2 Tim. i. 13] exhorts Timothy, (whom he had
set as Bp. over the Church of Ephesus,) to <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">hold fast</span></em>”</span> a
certain <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">form</span></em>”</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">“pattern”</span> (ὑποτύπωσιν) <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">of sound words</span></em>,
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">which</span></em>”</span> (said he) <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">thou hast heard of me</span></em>.”</span> The flexibility and
delicate precision of the Greek language enables the Apostle
to indicate exactly what was the prime object of his solicitude.
It proves to have been the safety of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the very words</span></em> which he
had syllabled, (ὑγιαινόντων λόγων ὯΝ παρ᾽ ἐμοῦ ἤκουσασ).
As learned Bp. Beveridge well points out,—<span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">which words</span></em>, not
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">which form</span></em>, thou hast heard of me. So that it is not so much
the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">form</span></em>, as the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">words</span></em> themselves, which the Apostle would
have him to hold fast.”</span><a id="noteref_789" name="noteref_789" href="#note_789"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">789</span></span></a>
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page352">[pg 352]</span><a name="Pg352" id="Pg352" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
All this however proves abhorrent to Dr. Hort. <span class="tei tei-q">“This
sense”</span> (says the learned Professor) <span class="tei tei-q">“cannot be obtained from
the text except by treating ὧν as put in the genitive by <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">an
unusual and inexplicable attraction</span></em>. It seems more probable
that ὧν is a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">primitive corruption</span></em> of ὅν after πάντων.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Now, this is quite impossible, since neither ὅν nor πάντων
occurs anywhere in the neighbourhood. And as for the supposed
<span class="tei tei-q">“unusual and inexplicable attraction,”</span> it happens to be
one of even common occurrence,—as every attentive reader
of the New Testament is aware. Examples of it may be
seen at 2 Cor. i. 4 and Ephes. iv. 1,—also (in Dr. Hort's text
of) Ephes. i. 6 (ἧς in all 3 places). Again, in S. Luke v. 9
(whether ᾗ or ὧν is read): and vi. 38 (ῷ):—in S. Jo. xv. 20
(οὗ):—and xvii. 11 (ᾧ): in Acts ii. 22 (οἷς): vii. 17 (ἧς) and
45 (ὧν): in xxii. 15 (ὧν),&amp;c.... But why entertain the
question? There is absolutely <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">no room</span></em> for such Criticism in
respect of a reading which is found <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in every known MS.,—in
every known Version,—in every Father who quotes the place</span></em>: a
reading which Divines, and Scholars who were not Divines,—Critics
of the Text, and grammarians who were without
prepossessions concerning Scripture,—Editors of the Greek
and Translators of the Greek into other languages,—all alike
have acquiesced in, from the beginning until now.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We venture to assert that it is absolutely unlawful, in
the entire absence of evidence, to call such a reading as the
present in question. There is absolutely no safeguard for
Scripture—no limit to Controversy—if a place like this may
be solicited at the mere suggestion of individual caprice.
(For it is worth observing that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">on this, and similar occasions,
Dr. Hort is forsaken by Dr. Westcott</span></em>. Such notes are enclosed
in brackets, and subscribed <span class="tei tei-q">“H.”</span>) In the meantime, who
can forbear smiling at the self-complacency of a Critic who
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page353">[pg 353]</span><a name="Pg353" id="Pg353" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
puts forth remarks like those which precede; and yet congratulates
himself on <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">personal endowments, fertility of resource,
and a too delicate appreciation of language</span></em>”</span>?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(b) Another specimen of conjectural extravagance occurs
at S. John vi. 4, where Dr. Hort labours to throw suspicion
on <span class="tei tei-q">“the Passover”</span> (τὸ πάσχα),—in defiance of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">every known
Manuscript,—every known Version</span></em>,—and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">every Father who
quotes or recognizes the place</span></em>.<a id="noteref_790" name="noteref_790" href="#note_790"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">790</span></span></a> We find <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">nine columns</span></em> devoted
to his vindication of this weak imagination; although so
partial are his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Notes</span></span>, that countless <span class="tei tei-q">“various Readings”</span> of
great interest and importance are left wholly undiscussed.
Nay, sometimes entire Epistles are dismissed with a single
weak annotation (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">e.g.</span></span> 1 and 2 Thessalonians),—<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">or with none</span></em>,
as in the case of the Epistle to the Philippians.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(c) We charitably presume that it is in order to make
amends for having conjecturally thrust out τὸ πάσχα from S.
John vi. 4,—that Dr. Hort is for conjecturally thrusting into
Acts xx. 28, Υἱοῦ (after τοῦ ἰδίου),—an imagination to which
he devotes a column and-a-half, but <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">for which he is not able to
produce a particle of evidence</span></em>. It would result in our reading,
<span class="tei tei-q">“to feed the Church of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">God</span></span>, which He purchased”</span>—(not
<span class="tei tei-q">“with <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">His own</span></em> blood,”</span> but)—<span class="tei tei-q">“with the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">blood of His own</span></em>
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Son</span></span>:”</span> which has evidently been suggested by nothing so
much as by the supposed necessity of getting rid of a text
which unequivocally asserts that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Christ</span></span> is <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">God</span></span>.<a id="noteref_791" name="noteref_791" href="#note_791"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">791</span></span></a>

LXXV. Some will be chiefly struck by the conceit and
presumption of such suggestions as the foregoing. A yet
larger number, as we believe, will be astonished by their
essential foolishness. For ourselves, what surprises us most
is the fatal misapprehension they evince of the true office
of Textual Criticism as applied to the New Testament. It
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">never is to invent new Readings</span></em>, but only to adjudicate
between existing and conflicting ones. He who seeks to
thrust out <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">the Passover</span></span>”</span> from S. John vi. 4, (where it may
on no account be dispensed with<a id="noteref_792" name="noteref_792" href="#note_792"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">792</span></span></a>); and to thrust <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">the Son</span></span>”</span>
into Acts xx. 28, (where His Name cannot stand without
evacuating a grand Theological statement);—will do well to
consider whether he does not bring himself directly under
the awful malediction with which the beloved Disciple concludes
and seals up the Canon of Scripture:—<span class="tei tei-q">“I testify unto
every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this

add unto him the plagues that are written in this Book.
And if any man shall <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">take away from</span></em> the words of the
Book of this prophecy, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">God</span></span> shall take away his part out of

LXXVIII. Whence is it,—(we have often asked ourselves
the question, while studying these laborious pages,)—How
does it happen that a scholar like Dr. Hort, evidently
accomplished and able, should habitually mistake the
creations of his own brain for material forms? the echoes
of his own voice while holding colloquy with himself, for
oracular responses? We have not hitherto expressed our
astonishment,—but must do so now before we make an end,—that
a writer who desires to convince, can suppose that
his own arbitrary use of such expressions as <span class="tei tei-q">“Pre-Syrian”</span>
and <span class="tei tei-q">“Neutral,”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“Western”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“Alexandrian,”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“Non-Western”</span>
and <span class="tei tei-q">“Non-Alexandrian,”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“Non-Alexandrian Pre-Syrian”</span>
and <span class="tei tei-q">“Pre-Syrian Non-Western,”</span>—will produce any
(except an irritating) effect on the mind of an intelligent reader.

The delusion of supposing that by the free use of such a
vocabulary a Critic may dispense with the ordinary processes
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page358">[pg 358]</span><a name="Pg358" id="Pg358" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of logical proof, might possibly have its beginning in the
retirement of the cloister, where there are few to listen and
none to contradict: but it can only prove abiding if there
has been no free ventilation of the individual fancy. Greatly
is it to be regretted that instead of keeping his Text a
profound secret for 30 years, Dr. Hort did not freely impart
it to the public, and solicit the favour of candid criticism.

them);—such expressions would only be allowable on the

Editors notice hostile evidence, they do so after a fashion
which can satisfy no one but themselves. Take for example
their note on the word εἰκῆ (<span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">without a cause</span></em>”</span>) in S. Matthew
v. 22 (<span class="tei tei-q">“But I say unto you, that whosoever is angry with his
brother <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">without a cause</span></em>”</span>). The Reader's attention is specially
invited to the treatment which this place has experienced at
the hands of Drs. Westcott and Hort:—

Coptic,—as well as by the Gothic—and Armenian versions;—that
such a reading is not to be set aside by the stupid
dictum, <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Western and Syrian</span></span>.”</span> By no such methods will the
study of Textual Criticism be promoted, or any progress ever
be made in determining the Truth of Scripture. There really
can be no doubt whatever,—(that is to say, if we are to be
guided by <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ancient Evidence</span></em>,)—that εἰκῆ (<span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">without a cause</span></em>”</span>) was
our <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Saviour's</span></span> actual word; and that our Revisers have been
here, as in so many hundred other places, led astray by Dr.
Hort. So true is that saying of the ancient poet,—<span class="tei tei-q">“Evil
company doth corrupt good manners.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“And if the blind
lead the blind,”</span>—(a greater than Menander hath said it,)—<span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">both

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">f</span></span>) In the meantime, we have exhibited somewhat in detail,

these two accomplished Professors. Their general practice,
as exhibited in the case of 1 Jo. v. 18, [see above, pp. <a href="#Pg347" class="tei tei-ref">347-9</a>,]
is to tamper with the sacred Text, without assigning their

his fellow Revisers to omit <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">without a cause</span></em>”</span> from their
Revised Version: and it is proposed, in consequence, that

in the same way for ever.... <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Delirant reges, plectuntur

have led them so to handle evidence, that the sense of proportion
seems to have forsaken them. <span class="tei tei-q">“He who has long
pondered over a train of Reasoning,”</span>—(remarks the elder

the <span class="tei tei-q">“idols of the den”</span> exercise at last a terrible ascendency
over the Critical judgment. It argues an utter want of
mental perspective, when we find <span class="tei tei-q">“the Man working on the
Sabbath,”</span> put on the same footing with <span class="tei tei-q">“the Woman taken
in Adultery,”</span> and conjectured to have <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">come from the same
source</span></em>:”</span>—the incident of <span class="tei tei-q">“the Angel troubling the pool of
Bethesda”</span> dismissed, as having <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">no claim to any kind of
association with the true Text</span></em>:”</span><a id="noteref_835" name="noteref_835" href="#note_835"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">835</span></span></a>—and <span class="tei tei-q">“the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">two</span></em> Supplements”</span>
to S. Mark's Gospel declared to <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">stand on equal terms</span></em> as
independent attempts to fill up a gap;”</span> and allowed to be
possibly <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">of equal antiquity.</span></em>”</span><a id="noteref_836" name="noteref_836" href="#note_836"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">836</span></span></a> How can we wonder, after
this, to find <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">anything</span></em> omitted,—<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">anything</span></em> inserted,—<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">anything</span></em>
branded with suspicion? And the brand is very freely applied
by Drs. Westcott and Hort. Their notion of the Text
of the New Testament, is certainly the most extraordinary
ever ventilated. It has at least the merit of entire originality.
While they eagerly insist that many a passage is but <span class="tei tei-q">“a
Western interpolation”</span> after all; is but an <span class="tei tei-q">“Evangelic Tradition,”</span>
<span class="tei tei-q">“rescued from oblivion by the Scribes of the second
century;”</span>—they yet <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">incorporate those passages with the
Gospel</span></em>. Careful enough to clap them into fetters first, they
then, (to use their own queer phrase,)—<span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">provisionally
associate them with the Text</span></em>.”</span>

<span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">cannot doubt</span></em>”</span> that a certain verse <span class="tei tei-q">“comes from an extraneous
source,”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">do not believe</span></em> that it belonged originally to the
Book in which it is now included,”</span>—are unreasonable if they
proceed to assign to it <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">any</span></em> actual place there at all. When
men have once thoroughly convinced themselves that two
Verses of S. Luke's Gospel are <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">not Scripture</span></em>, but <span class="tei tei-q">“only a
fragment from the Traditions, written or oral, which were
for a while locally current;”</span><a id="noteref_837" name="noteref_837" href="#note_837"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">837</span></span></a>—what else is it but the
merest trifling with sacred Truth, to promote those two
verses to a place in the inspired context? Is it not to be
feared, that the conscious introduction of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">human Tradition</span></em>
into <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">God's</span></span> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">written Word</span></em> will in the end destroy the soul's
confidence in Scripture itself? opening the door for perplexity,
and doubt, and presently for Unbelief itself to enter.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
LXXXII. And let us not be told that the Verses stand
there <span class="tei tei-q">“provisionally”</span> only; and for that reason are <span class="tei tei-q">“enclosed
within double brackets.”</span> Suspected felons are <span class="tei tei-q">“provisionally”</span>
locked up, it is true: but after trial, they are either convicted
and removed out of sight; or else they are acquitted
and suffered to come abroad like other men. Drs. Westcott
and Hort have <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">no right</span></em> at the end of thirty years of investigation,
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">still</span></em> to encumber the Evangelists with <span class="tei tei-q">“provisional”</span>
fetters. Those fetters either signify that the Judge is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">afraid
to carry out his own righteous sentence</span></em>: or else, that he <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">entertains
a secret suspicion that he has made a terrible mistake
after all,—has condemned the innocent</span></em>. Let these esteemed
Scholars at least have <span class="tei tei-q">“the courage of their own convictions,”</span>
and be throughout as consistent as, in two famous instances
(viz. at pages 113 and 241), they have been. Else, in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">God's</span></span>

error: abjure their πρῶτον ψεῦδος; and cast the fantastic
Theory, which they have so industriously reared upon it,
unreservedly, to the winds!

LXXXIII. To conclude.—It will be the abiding distinction
of the Revised Version (<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">thanks to Dr. Hort,</span></em>) that it brought
to the front a question which has slept for about 100 years;
but which may not be suffered now to rest undisturbed any
longer. It might have slumbered on for another half-century,—a
subject of deep interest to a very little band of
Divines and Scholars; of perplexity and distrust to all the
World besides;—<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">but</span></em> for the incident which will make the
17th of May, 1881, for ever memorable in the Annals of the
Church of England.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
LXXXIV. The Publication on that day of the <span class="tei tei-q">“Revised
English Version of the New Testament”</span> instantly concentrated
public attention on the neglected problem: for men
saw at a glance that the Traditional Text of 1530 years'
standing,—(the exact number is Dr. Hort's, not ours,)—had
been unceremoniously set aside in favour of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">an entirely different
Recension</span></em>. The true Authors of the mischief were not far to
seek. Just five days before,—under the editorship of Drs.
Westcott and Hort, (Revisionists themselves,)—had appeared
the most extravagant Text which has seen the light since the
invention of Printing. No secret was made of the fact that,
under pledges of strictest secrecy,<a id="noteref_838" name="noteref_838" href="#note_838"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">838</span></span></a> a copy of this wild performance
(marked <span class="tei tei-q">“Confidential”</span>) had been entrusted to
every member of the Revising body: and it has since transpired
that Dr. Hort advocated his own peculiar views in the
Jerusalem Chamber with so much volubility, eagerness, pertinacity,
and plausibility, that in the end—notwithstanding
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page365">[pg 365]</span><a name="Pg365" id="Pg365" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the warnings, remonstrances, entreaties of Dr. Scrivener,—his
counsels prevailed; and—the utter shipwreck of the
<span class="tei tei-q">“Revised Version”</span> has been, (as might have been confidently
predicted,) the disastrous consequence. Dr. Hort is calculated
to have <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">talked for three years</span></em> out of the ten.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But in the meantime there has arisen <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">this</span></em> good out of the
calamity,—namely, that men will at last require that the
Textual problem shall be fairly threshed out. They will
insist on having it proved to their satisfaction,—(1) That
Codices <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b</span></span> and א are indeed the oracular documents which
their admirers pretend; and—(2) That a narrow selection
of ancient documents is a secure foundation on which to
build the Text of Scripture. Failing this,—(and the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">onus
probandi</span></span> rests wholly with those who are for setting aside
the Traditional Text in favour of another, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">entirely dissimilar
in character</span></em>,)—failing this, we say, it is reasonable to hope
that the counsels of the <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Quarterly Review</span></span>”</span> will be suffered
to prevail. In the meantime, we repeat that this question
has now to be fought out: for to ignore it any longer is
impossible. Compromise of any sort between the two conflicting
parties, is impossible also; for they simply contradict
one another. Codd. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b</span></span> and א are either among the purest
of manuscripts,—or else they are among the very foulest.
The Text of Drs. Westcott and Hort is either the very best
which has ever appeared,—or else it is the very worst; the
nearest to the sacred Autographs,—or the furthest from them.
There is no room for <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">both</span></em> opinions; and there cannot exist
any middle view.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The question will have to be fought out; and it must be
fought out fairly. It may not be magisterially settled; but
must be advocated, on either side, by the old logical method.
If Continental Scholars join in the fray, England,—which
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page366">[pg 366]</span><a name="Pg366" id="Pg366" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
in the last century took the lead in these studies,—will, it
is to be hoped, maintain her ancient reputation and again
occupy the front rank. The combatants may be sure that,
in consequence of all that has happened, the public will be
no longer indifferent spectators of the fray; for the issue
concerns the inner life of the whole community,—touches
men's very heart of hearts. Certain it is that—<span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">God</span></span> defend
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the Right</span></em>!”</span> will be the one aspiration of every faithful spirit
among us. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">The Truth</span></span>,—(we avow it on behalf of Drs.
Westcott and Hort as eagerly as on our own behalf,)—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">God's
Truth</span></span> will be, as it has been throughout, the one object of
all our striving. Αἴλινον αἴλινον εἰπέ, τὸ δ᾽ εὖ νικάτω.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
You may be quite sure that I examined your pamphlet as
soon as it appeared, with attention. I have since read it
through several times: and—I must add—with ever-increasing
astonishment. First, because it is so evidently the production
of one who has never made Textual Criticism seriously his
study. Next, because your pamphlet is no refutation whatever
of my two Articles. You flout me: you scold me: you lecture
me. But I do not find that you ever <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">answer</span></em> me. You reproduce
the theory of Drs. Westcott and Hort,—which I
claim to have demolished.<a id="noteref_847" name="noteref_847" href="#note_847"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">847</span></span></a> You seek to put me down by
flourishing in my face the decrees of Lachmann, Tischendorf
and Tregelles,—which, as you are well aware, I entirely disallow.
Denunciation, my lord Bishop, is not Argument;
neither is Reiteration, Proof. And then,—Why do you impute
to me opinions which I do not hold? and charge me with a
method of procedure of which I have never been guilty?
Above all, why do you seek to prejudice the question at
issue between us by importing irrelevant matter which can
only impose upon the ignorant and mislead the unwary?
Forgive my plainness, but really you are so conspicuously
unfair,—and at the same time so manifestly unacquainted,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page371">[pg 371]</span><a name="Pg371" id="Pg371" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
(except at second-hand and only in an elementary way,)
with the points actually under discussion,—that, were it not
for the adventitious importance attaching to any utterance of
yours, deliberately put forth at this time as Chairman of the
New Testament body of Revisers, I should have taken no
notice of your pamphlet.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I am bound, at the same time, to acknowledge that you
have been singularly unlucky. While <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">you</span></em> were penning

was anticipated,—had in fact been fully disposed of,
three weeks before it appeared. <span class="tei tei-q">“The Reviewer,”</span> (you complain

explained,) the <span class="tei tei-q">“serious examination”</span> which you reproach
me with having hitherto failed to produce,—had been already
three weeks in the hands of readers of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Quarterly</span></span> before
your pamphlet saw the light. You would, in consequence,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page372">[pg 372]</span><a name="Pg372" id="Pg372" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
have best consulted your own reputation, I am persuaded,

again,—<span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">We find nothing in the Reviewer's third article to
require further answer from us:</span></em>”</span>—passes my comprehension;
seeing that your pamphlet (page 11 to page 29) is an
elaborate avowal that you have made Westcott and Hort's
theory entirely your own. The Editor of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Speaker's
Commentary</span></span>, I observe, takes precisely the same view of
your position. <span class="tei tei-q">“The two Revisers”</span> (says Canon Cook)
<span class="tei tei-q">“actually add a Postscript to their pamphlet of a single

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I should enter at once on an examination of your Reply,
but that I am constrained at the outset to remonstrate with you
on the exceeding unfairness of your entire method of procedure.
Your business was to make it plain to the public that you
have dealt faithfully with the Deposit: have strictly fulfilled
the covenant into which you entered twelve years ago with
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page373">[pg 373]</span><a name="Pg373" id="Pg373" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the Convocation of the Southern Province: have corrected
only <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">plain and clear errors</span></em>.”</span> Instead of this, you labour to
enlist vulgar prejudice against me:—partly, by insisting that
I am for determining disputed Readings by an appeal to the
<span class="tei tei-q">“Textus Receptus,”</span>—which (according to you) I look upon as
faultless:—partly, by exhibiting me in disagreement with
Lachmann, Tischendorf and Tregelles. The irrelevancy of
this latter contention,—the groundlessness of the former,—may
not be passed over without a few words of serious remonstrance.
For I claim that, in discussing the Greek Text,
I have invariably filled my pages as full of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Authorities</span></em>
for the opinions I advocate, as the limits of the page would
allow. I may have been tediously demonstrative sometimes:
but no one can fairly tax me with having shrunk from the
severest method of evidential proof. To find myself therefore
charged with <span class="tei tei-q">“mere denunciation,”</span><a id="noteref_851" name="noteref_851" href="#note_851"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">851</span></span></a>—with substituting
<span class="tei tei-q">“strong expressions of individual opinion”</span> for <span class="tei tei-q">“arguments,”</span><a id="noteref_852" name="noteref_852" href="#note_852"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">852</span></span></a>—and
with <span class="tei tei-q">“attempting to cut the cord by reckless and unverified
assertions,”</span> (p. 25,)—astonishes me. Such language
is in fact even ridiculously unfair.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The misrepresentation of which I complain is not only
conspicuous, but systematic. It runs through your whole

A robust confidence in the revelations of their own inner
consciousness: and (2ndly) A superstitious partiality for
two codices written in the uncial character,—for which partiality
they are able to assign no intelligible reason. You put
the matter as neatly as I could desire at page 19 of your

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page376">[pg 376]</span><a name="Pg376" id="Pg376" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Textus Receptus</span></span> on the other,—simultaneously to one
and the same external standard? Have I not persistently
enquired for the verdict—so far as it has been obtainable—of
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">consentient Antiquity</span></span>? If I have sometimes spoken of
certain famous manuscripts (א <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b c d</span></span> namely,) as exhibiting
fabricated Texts, have I not been at the pains to establish the
reasonableness of my assertion by showing that they yield
divergent,—that is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">contradictory</span></em>, testimony?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The task of laboriously collating the five <span class="tei tei-q">“old uncials”</span>
throughout the Gospels, occupied me for five-and-a-half years,
and taxed me severely. But I was rewarded. I rose from the
investigation profoundly convinced that, however important
they may be as instruments of Criticism, codices א <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b c d</span></span> are
among the most corrupt documents extant. It was a conviction
derived from exact <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Knowledge</span></em> and based on solid
grounds of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Reason</span></em>. You, my lord Bishop, who have never
gone deeply into the subject, repose simply on <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Prejudice</span></em>.
Never having at any time collated codices א <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a b c d</span></span> for yourself,
you are unable to gainsay a single statement of mine
by a counter-appeal to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">facts</span></em>. Your textual learning proves
to have been all obtained at second-hand,—taken on trust.
And so, instead of marshalling against me a corresponding
array of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Ancient Authorities</span></span>,—you invariably attempt to
put me down by an appeal to <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Modern Opinion</span></span>. <span class="tei tei-q">“The
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">majority of modern Critics</span></em>”</span> (you say) have declared the
manuscripts in question <span class="tei tei-q">“not only to be wholly undeserving
of such charges, but, on the contrary, to exhibit a text of
comparative purity.”</span><a id="noteref_859" name="noteref_859" href="#note_859"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">859</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The sum of the difference therefore between our respective
methods, my lord Bishop, proves to be this:—that
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page377">[pg 377]</span><a name="Pg377" id="Pg377" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
whereas <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">I</span></em> endeavour by a laborious accumulation of
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ancient Evidence</span></em> to demonstrate that the decrees of Lachmann,
of Tischendorf and of Tregelles, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">are untrustworthy</span></em>;
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">your</span></em> way of reducing me to silence, is to cast Lachmann,
Tregelles and Tischendorf at every instant in my teeth. You
make your appeal exclusively to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">them</span></em>. <span class="tei tei-q">“It would be difficult”</span>
(you say) <span class="tei tei-q">“to find a recent English Commentator of
any considerable reputation who has not been influenced, more
or less consistently, by <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">one or the other of these three Editors</span></em>:”</span><a id="noteref_860" name="noteref_860" href="#note_860"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">860</span></span></a>
(as if <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">that</span></em> were any reason why I should do the same!)
Because I pronounce the Revised reading of S. Luke ii. 14,
<span class="tei tei-q">“a grievous perversion of the truth of Scripture,”</span> you bid me
consider <span class="tei tei-q">“that in so speaking I am <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">censuring Lachmann,
Tischendorf and Tregelles</span></em>.”</span> You seem in fact to have utterly
missed the point of my contention: which is, that the
ancient Fathers collectively (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 150 to <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 450),—inasmuch
as they must needs have known far better than Lachmann,
Tregelles, or Tischendorf, (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1830 to <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1880,) what was
the Text of the New Testament in the earliest ages,—are
perforce far more trustworthy guides than they. And further,
that whenever it can be clearly shown that the Ancients as a
body say one thing, and the Moderns another, the opinion of
the Moderns may be safely disregarded.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
When therefore I open your pamphlet at the first page,
and read as follows:—<span class="tei tei-q">“A bold assault has been made in
recent numbers of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Quarterly Review</span></span> upon the whole

inconvenience results to myself from your announcement.
The same plaintive strain reappears at p. 39; where, having
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page378">[pg 378]</span><a name="Pg378" id="Pg378" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
pointed out <span class="tei tei-q">“that the text of the Revisers is, in all essential
features, the same as that text in which the best critical
editors, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">during the past fifty years</span></em>, are generally agreed,”</span>—you
insist <span class="tei tei-q">“that thus, any attack made on the text of the

have been carefully and laboriously established <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">during the

you conclude your labours. <span class="tei tei-q">“If,”</span> (you say) <span class="tei tei-q">“the Revisers

which seems to you so alarming is in fact my whole contention?
What else do you imagine it is that I am proposing
to myself throughout, but effectually to dispel the
vulgar prejudice,—say rather, to plant my heel upon the
weak superstition,—which <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">for the last fifty years</span></em>”</span> has proved
fatal to progress in this department of learning; and which,
if it be suffered to prevail, will make <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">a science</span></em> of Textual
Criticism impossible? A shallow empiricism has been the
prevailing result, up to this hour, of the teaching of
Lachmann, and Tischendorf, and Tregelles.

Westcott and Hort have been for thirty years building
up their visionary Theory of Textual Criticism?—What
Griesbach attempted [1774-1805], was denounced [1782-1805]
by C. F. Matthæi;—disapproved by Scholz;—demonstrated
to be untenable by Abp. Laurence. Finally,
in 1847, the learned J. G. Reiche, in some Observations
prefixed to his Collations of MSS. in the Paris Library,
eloquently and ably exposed the unreasonableness of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">any</span></em>
theory of <span class="tei tei-q">“Recension,”</span>—properly so called;<a id="noteref_866" name="noteref_866" href="#note_866"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">866</span></span></a> thereby effectually
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page381">[pg 381]</span><a name="Pg381" id="Pg381" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
anticipating Westcott and Hort's weak imagination
of a <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Syrian</span></em> Text,”</span> while he was demolishing the airy
speculations of Griesbach and Hug. <span class="tei tei-q">“There is no royal
road”</span> (he said) <span class="tei tei-q">“to the Criticism of the N. T.: no plain and
easy method, at once reposing on a firm foundation, and
conducting securely to the wished for goal.”</span><a id="noteref_867" name="noteref_867" href="#note_867"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">867</span></span></a>... Scarcely
therefore in Germany had the basement-story been laid
of that <span class="tei tei-q">“fabric of Criticism which has been built up during
the last fifty years,”</span> and which <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">you</span></em> superstitiously admire,—when
a famous German scholar was heard denouncing the
fabric as insecure. He foretold that the <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">regia via</span></span>”</span> of
codices <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b</span></span> and א would prove a deceit and a snare: which
thing, at the end of four-and-thirty years, has punctually
come to pass.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Seven years after, Lachmann's method was solemnly
appealed from by the same J. G. Reiche:<a id="noteref_868" name="noteref_868" href="#note_868"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">868</span></span></a> whose words of
warning to his countrymen deserve the attention of every
thoughtful scholar among ourselves at this day. Of the
same general tenor and purport as Reiche's, are the utterances
of those giants in Textual Criticism, Vercellone of
Rome and Ceriani of Milan. Quite unmistakable is the
verdict of our own Scrivener concerning the views of
Lachmann, Tischendorf and Tregelles, and the results to
which their system has severally conducted them.—If Alford
adopted the prejudices of his three immediate predecessors,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page382">[pg 382]</span><a name="Pg382" id="Pg382" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
his authority has been neutralized by the far different teaching
of one infinitely his superior in judgment and learning,—the
present illustrious Bishop of Lincoln.—On the same
side with the last named are found the late Philip E. Pusey
and Archd. Lee,—Canon Cook and Dr. Field,—the Bishop of
S. Andrews and Dr. S. C. Malan. Lastly, at the end of
fifty-one years, (viz. in 1881,) Drs. Westcott and Hort have
revived Lachmann's unsatisfactory method,—superadding
thereto not a few extravagances of their own. That their
views have been received with expressions of the gravest
disapprobation, no one will deny. Indispensable to their
contention is the grossly improbable hypothesis that the
Peschito is to be regarded as the <span class="tei tei-q">“Vulgate”</span> (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Revised</span></em>)
Syriac; Cureton's, as the <span class="tei tei-q">“Vetus”</span> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">original</span></em> Syriac version.
And yet, while I write, the Abbé Martin at Paris is giving it
as the result of his labours on this subject, that Cureton's
Version cannot be anything of the sort.<a id="noteref_869" name="noteref_869" href="#note_869"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">869</span></span></a> Whether Westcott

From which it becomes apparent that, at all events, <span class="tei tei-q">“the
fabric of Criticism which has been built up within the last
fifty years”</span> has not arisen without solemn and repeated
protest,—as well from within as from without. It may not
therefore be spoken of by you as something which men are
bound to maintain inviolate,—like an Article of the Creed.
It is quite competent, I mean, for any one to denounce the
entire system of Lachmann, Tischendorf and Tregelles,—<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">as I
do now</span></em>,—as an egregious blunder; if he will but be at the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page383">[pg 383]</span><a name="Pg383" id="Pg383" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
pains to establish on a severe logical basis the contradictory
of not a few of their most important decrees. And you, my
lord Bishop, are respectfully reminded that your defence of
their system,—if you must needs defend what I deem
worthless,—must be conducted, not by sneers and an affectation
of superior enlightenment; still less by intimidation,
scornful language, and all those other bad methods whereby
it has been the way of Superstition in every age to rivet the
fetters of intellectual bondage: but by severe reasoning, and
calm discussion, and a free appeal to ancient Authority, and
a patient investigation of all the external evidence accessible.
I request therefore that we may hear no more of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">this</span></em> form
of argument. The Text of Lachmann and Tischendorf and
Tregelles,—of Westcott and Hort and Ellicott, (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">of the

Really, my lord Bishop, you must excuse me if I declare
plainly that the more I attend to your critical utterances, the
more I am astonished. From the confident style in which
you deliver yourself upon such matters, and especially from
your having undertaken to preside over a Revision of the
Sacred Text, one would suppose that at some period of your
life you must have given the subject a considerable amount
of time and attention. But indeed the foregoing sentence
virtually contains two propositions neither of which could
possibly have been penned by one even moderately
acquainted with the facts of Textual Criticism. For first,
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">a</span></span>) You speak of <span class="tei tei-q">“representing <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">verbatim et literatim</span></span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">the</span></span>

Do you then really suppose that there existed at
Antioch, at any period between <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 354 and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 407, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">some
one definite Text of the N. T. </span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">capable</span></span><span style="font-style: italic"> of being so represented</span></em>?—If
you do, pray will you indulge us with the grounds for
such an extraordinary supposition? Your <span class="tei tei-q">“acquaintance”</span>
(Dr. Tregelles) will tell you that such a fancy has long since
been swept away <span class="tei tei-q">“at once and for ever.”</span> And secondly,
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">b</span></span>) You say that, even if there were reason to suppose that
the <span class="tei tei-q">“Received Text”</span> were such-and-such a thing,—<span class="tei tei-q">“it would
still be impossible to regard it as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">a standard from which there

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But pray, who in his senses,—what sane man in Great
Britain,—ever dreamed of regarding the <span class="tei tei-q">“Received,”</span>—aye, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">or

But, do you really require to have it explained to you that
it is entirely to misunderstand the question to object to such
a comparison of codices as is found above, (viz. in pages 14

reason why this would be impossible may be stated briefly as

us,—amongst which, as is well known, are manuscripts written
in the fourth century,—we possess evidence that other texts of
the Greek Testament existed in the age of Chrysostom, materially
different from the text which he and the Antiochian writers
generally employed. Moreover, a rigorous examination of
extant documents shows that the Antiochian or (as we shall
henceforth call it with Dr. Hort) the Syrian text did not
represent an earlier tradition than those other texts, but was
in fact of later origin than the rest. We cannot accept it

the matter for a moment. <span class="tei tei-q">“A rigorous examination of

<span class="tei tei-q">“A rigorous examination of the”</span> same <span class="tei tei-q">“documents shows”</span>
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">me</span></em>—that Dr. Hort <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">is mistaken</span></em>. A careful study of his book
convinces <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">me</span></em> that his theory of a Syrian Recension, manufactured
between <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 250 and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 350, is a dream, pure and
simple—<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">a mere phantom of the brain</span></em>. Dr. Hort's course is
obvious. Let him <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">first</span></em> make his processes of proof intelligible,
and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">then</span></em> public. You cannot possibly suppose that the fable
of <span class="tei tei-q">“a Syrian text,”</span> though it has evidently satisfied <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">you</span></em>,
will be accepted by thoughtful Englishmen without proof.
What prospect do you suppose you have of convincing the
world that Dr. Hort is competent to assign <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">a date</span></em> to this
creature of his own imagination; of which he has hitherto
failed to demonstrate so much as the probable existence?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I have, for my own part, established by abundant references
to his writings that he is one of those who, (through
some intellectual peculiarity,) are for ever mistaking
conjectures for facts,—assertions for arguments,—and reiterated
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page394">[pg 394]</span><a name="Pg394" id="Pg394" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
asseveration for accumulated proof. He deserves
sympathy, certainly: for,—(like the man who passed his life
in trying to count how many grains of sand will exactly fill
a quart pot;—or like his unfortunate brother, who made it
his business to prove that nothing, multiplied by a sufficient
number of figures, amounts to something;)—he has evidently
taken a prodigious deal of useless trouble. The spectacle
of an able and estimable man exhibiting such singular inaptitude
for a province of study which, beyond all others,
demands a clear head and a calm, dispassionate judgment,—creates
distress.

<span class="tei tei-q">“Syriac Vulgate;”</span> which (it seems) bears <span class="tei tei-q">“indisputable
traces”</span> of being a revision, of which you have learned <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">from
Dr. Hort</span></em> the date:<a id="noteref_882" name="noteref_882" href="#note_882"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">882</span></span></a>—then comes the same disparagement of
the ancient Greek Fathers,—<span class="tei tei-q">“for reasons which have been
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">stated by Dr. Hort</span></em> with great clearness and cogency:”</span><a id="noteref_883" name="noteref_883" href="#note_883"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">883</span></span></a>—then,
the same depreciatory estimate of writers subsequent

on no higher level than the evidence of inferior manuscripts
in the uncial class:”</span><a id="noteref_884" name="noteref_884" href="#note_884"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">884</span></span></a> but <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">only</span></em> because it is discovered to be
destructive of the theory <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">of Dr. Hort</span></em>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Next comes <span class="tei tei-q">“the Method of Genealogy,”</span>—which you
declare is the result of <span class="tei tei-q">“vast research, unwearied patience,
great critical sagacity;”</span><a id="noteref_885" name="noteref_885" href="#note_885"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">885</span></span></a> but which I am prepared to prove
is, on the contrary, a shallow expedient for dispensing with
scientific Induction and the laborious accumulation of evidence.
This same <span class="tei tei-q">“Method of Genealogy,”</span> you are not
ashamed to announce as <span class="tei tei-q">“the great contribution of our own
times to a mastery over materials.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“For the full explanation

Can you be serious?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Then come the results to which <span class="tei tei-q">“the application of this

the fable of the <span class="tei tei-q">“Syrian Text”</span>—which <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Dr. Hort considers</span></em> to
have been the result of a deliberate Recension,”</span> conducted
on erroneous principles. This fabricated product of the IIIrd
and IVth centuries, (you say,) rose to supremacy,—became
dominant at Antioch,—passed thence to Constantinople,—and
once established there, soon vindicated its claim to be
the N. T. of the East: whence it overran the West, and for
300 years as the <span class="tei tei-q">“Textus Receptus,”</span> has held undisputed
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page396">[pg 396]</span><a name="Pg396" id="Pg396" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
sway.<a id="noteref_888" name="noteref_888" href="#note_888"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">888</span></span></a> Really, my lord Bishop, you describe imaginary
events in truly Oriental style. One seems to be reading not
so much of the <span class="tei tei-q">“Syrian Text”</span> as of the Syrian Impostor.
One expects every moment to hear of some feat of this
fabulous Recension corresponding with the surrender of
the British troops and Arabi's triumphant entry into Cairo
with the head of Sir Beauchamp Seymour in his hand!
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
All this is followed, of course, by the weak fable of the
<span class="tei tei-q">“Neutral”</span> Text, and of the absolute supremacy of Codex <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b</span></span>,—which
is <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">stated in Dr. Hort's own words</span></em>:”</span><a id="noteref_889" name="noteref_889" href="#note_889"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">889</span></span></a>—viz. <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b</span></span> very
far exceeds all other documents in neutrality of text, being
in fact always, or nearly always, neutral.”</span> (The <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">fact</span></em> being
that codex <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b</span></span> is demonstrably one of the most corrupt documents
in existence.) The posteriority of the (imaginary)
<span class="tei tei-q">“Syrian,”</span> to the (imaginary) <span class="tei tei-q">“Neutral,”</span> is insisted upon
next in order, as a matter of course: and declared to rest
upon three other considerations,—each one of which is found
to be pure fable: viz. (1) On the fable of <span class="tei tei-q">“Conflation,”</span> which
<span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">seems</span></em> to supply a proof”</span> that Syrian readings are posterior
both to Western and to Neutral readings—but, (as I have
elsewhere<a id="noteref_890" name="noteref_890" href="#note_890"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">890</span></span></a> shown, at considerable length,) most certainly <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">does</span></em>
not:—(2) On Ante-Nicene Patristic evidence,—of which
however not a syllable is produced:—(3) On <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Transcriptional
probability</span></em>”</span>—which is about as useful a substitute for
proof as a sweet-pea for a walking-stick.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Widely dissimilar of course is your own view of the
importance of the foregoing instruments of conviction. To
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">you</span></em>, <span class="tei tei-q">“these three reasons taken together seem to make up
an argument for the posteriority of the Syrian Text, which it
is impossible to resist. They form”</span> (you say) <span class="tei tei-q">“a threefold

So effectually, as well as so deliberately, have you lashed
yourself—for better or for worse—to Westcott and Hort's
New Textual Theory, that you must now of necessity either
share its future triumphs, or else be a partaker in its coming
humiliation. Am I to congratulate you on your prospects?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
For my part, I make no secret of the fact that I look
upon the entire speculation about which you are so enthusiastic,
as an excursion into cloud-land: a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">dream</span></em> and nothing
more. My contention is,—<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">not</span></em> that the Theory of Drs. Westcott
and Hort rests on an <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">insecure</span></em> foundation, but, that it
rests on <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">no foundation at all</span></em>. Moreover, I am greatly mistaken
if this has not been <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">demonstrated</span></em> in the foregoing
pages.<a id="noteref_892" name="noteref_892" href="#note_892"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">892</span></span></a> On one point, at all events, there cannot exist a
particle of doubt; namely, that so far from its <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">not being for
you to interpose in this controversy</span></em>”</span>—you are without alternative.
You must either come forward at once, and bring it to
a successful issue: or else, you must submit to be told that
you have suffered defeat, inasmuch as you are inextricably
involved in Westcott and Hort's discomfiture. You are simply
without remedy. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">You</span></em> may <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">find nothing in the Reviewer's
third article to require a further answer</span></em>:”</span> but readers of
intelligence will tell you that your finding, since it does not
proceed from stupidity, can only result from your consciousness
that you have made a serious blunder: and that now,
the less you say about <span class="tei tei-q">“Westcott and Hort's new textual
Theory,”</span> the better.

over the deliberations of the Revisionists as an impartial

partizan. You have learned to employ freely Drs. Westcott

it is high time that I should pass on.

<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">undoubtedly</span></em> genuine. I wonder how you can have ventured

not, out of common decency and reverence, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">at least in the

you thus,—with well-meant assiduity, but certainly with
deplorable rashness,—forcibly ejected from the text?
To proceed however.—<span class="tei tei-q">“Multitudes,”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“but,”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“one,”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“did,”</span>— <span class="tei tei-q">“power,”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“forth,”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“from:”</span>—are

as renderings of συνέχουσι and ἀποθλίβουσι, are inexact and
unscholarlike. Συνέχειν, (literally <span class="tei tei-q">“to encompass”</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">“hem

<span class="tei tei-q">“to squeeze,”</span>) is here to <span class="tei tei-q">“press.”</span> But in fact the words were
perfectly well rendered by our Translators of 1611, and
ought to have been let alone.—This specimen may suffice,
(and it is a very fair specimen,) of what has been your
calamitous method of revising the A. V. throughout.

On examining the 836<a id="noteref_899" name="noteref_899" href="#note_899"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">899</span></span></a> Greek Textual corrections which
you have introduced into those 1151 verses, I find that at least
356 of them <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">do not affect the English rendering at all</span></em>. I mean
to say that those 356 (supposed) emendations are either
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">incapable</span></em> of being represented in a Translation, or at least
are <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">not</span></em> represented. Thus, in S. Luke iv. 3, whether εἶπε
δέ or καὶ εἶπεν is read:—in ver. 7, whether ἐμοῦ or μου:—in
ver. 8, whether Κύριον τὸν Θεόν σου προσκυνήσες, or Προσκυνήσεις
Κ. τὸν Θ. σου; whether ἤγαγε δέ or καὶ ἤγαγεν;
whether υἱός or ὁ υἱός:—in ver. 17, whether τοῦ προφήτου
Ἡσαïου or Ἡ. τοῦ προφήτου; whether ἀνοίξας or ἀναπτύξας:—in
ver. 18, whether εὐαγγελίσασθαι or εὐαγγελίζεσθαι:—in
ver. 20, whether οἱ ὀφθαλμοὶ ἐν τῇ συναγωγῇ or ἐν τῇ συναγωγῇ
οἱ ὀφθαλμοί:—in ver. 23, whether εἰς τήν or ἐν τῇ:—in ver. 27,
whether ἐν τῷ Ἰσραὴλ ἐπὶ Ἐλισσαίου τοῦ προφήτου or ἐπὶ
Ἐλισσ., τοῦ π. ἐν τῷ Ἰ.:—in ver. 29, whether ὀφρύος or τῆς
ὀφρύος; whether ὥστε or εἰς τό:—in ver. 35, whether ἀπ᾽ or
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page404">[pg 404]</span><a name="Pg404" id="Pg404" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

ἡ πενθερά:—in ver. 43, whether ἐπί or εἰς; whether
ἀπεστάλην or ἀπέσταλμαι:—in ver. 44, whether εἰς τὰς
συναγωγάς or ἐν ταῖς συναγωγαῖς:—in every one of these
cases, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the English remains the same</span></em>, whichever of the
alternative readings is adopted. At least 19 therefore out
of the 33 changes which you introduced into the Greek Text
of S. Luke iv. are plainly gratuitous.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Thirteen</span></em> of those 19, (or about two-thirds,) are also in my
opinion changes <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">for</span></em> the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">worse</span></em>: are nothing else, I mean, but
substitutions of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">wrong for right</span></em> Readings. But <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">that</span></em> is not
my present contention. The point I am just now contending
for is this:—That, since it certainly was no part of your
<span class="tei tei-q">“Instructions,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Rules,”</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">“Principles”</span> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">to invent a new Greek
Text</span></em>,—or indeed to meddle with the original Greek at all,
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">except so far as was absolutely necessary for the Revision of the
English Version</span></em>,—it is surely a very grave form of inaccuracy
to assert (as you now do) that you <span class="tei tei-q">“adhered most closely to
your Instructions, and did neither more nor less than you
were required.”</span>—You <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">know</span></em> that you did a vast deal more
than you had any authority or right to do: a vast deal more
than you had the shadow of a pretext for doing. Worse than
that. You deliberately forsook the province to which you
had been exclusively appointed by the Southern Convocation,—and
you ostentatiously invaded another and a distinct
province; viz. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">That</span></em> of the critical Editorship of the Greek
Text: for which, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">by your own confession</span></em>,—(I take leave to
remind you of your own honest avowal, quoted above at
page <a href="#Pg369" class="tei tei-ref">369</a>,)—you and your colleagues <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">knew</span></em> yourselves to be
incompetent.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
For, when those 356 wholly gratuitous and uncalled-for
changes in the Greek of S. Luke's Gospel come to be
examined in detail, they are found to affect far more than
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page405">[pg 405]</span><a name="Pg405" id="Pg405" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
356 words. By the result, 92 words have been omitted;
and 33 added. No less than 129 words have been substituted
for others which stood in the text before; and there are 66
instances of Transposition, involving the dislocation of 185
words. The changes of case, mood, tense, &amp;c., amount in
addition to 123.<a id="noteref_900" name="noteref_900" href="#note_900"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">900</span></span></a> The sum of the words which you have
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">needlessly</span></em> meddled with in the Greek Text of the third
Gospel proves therefore to be 562.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
At this rate,—(since, [excluding marginal notes and
variations in stops,] Scrivener<a id="noteref_901" name="noteref_901" href="#note_901"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">901</span></span></a> counts 5337 various readings
in his Notes,)—the number of alterations <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">gratuitously and
uselessly introduced by you into the Greek Text of the entire
N. T.</span></em>, is to be estimated at 3590.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And if,—(as seems probable,)—the same general proportion
prevails throughout your entire work,—it will appear that
the words which, without a shadow of excuse, you have
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">omitted</span></em> from the Greek Text of the N. T., must amount to
about 590: while you have <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">added</span></em> in the same gratuitous
way about 210; and have needlessly <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">substituted</span></em> about 820.
Your instances of uncalled-for <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">transposition</span></em>, (about 420 in
number,) will have involved the gratuitous dislocation of full
1190 words:—while the occasions on which, at the bidding
of Drs. Westcott and Hort, you have altered case, mood,
tense, &amp;c., must amount to about 780. In this way, the
sum of the changes you have effected in the Greek Text of
the N. T. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in clear defiance of your Instructions</span></em>,—would
amount, as already stated, to 3590.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Now, when it is considered that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">not one</span></em> of those 3590
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page406">[pg 406]</span><a name="Pg406" id="Pg406" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
changes <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in the least degree affects the English Revision</span></em>,—it is
undeniable, not only that you and your friends did what you
were without authority for doing:—but also that you violated
as well the spirit as the letter of your Instructions. As for
your present assertion (at p. 32) that you <span class="tei tei-q">“adhered <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">most
closely</span></em> to the Instructions you received, and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">did neither more
nor less than you were required to do</span></em>,”</span>—you must submit to
be reminded that it savours strongly of the nature of pure
fable. The history of the new Greek Text is briefly this:—A
majority of the Revisers—<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">including yourself, their Chairman</span></em>,—are
found to have put yourselves almost unreservedly
into the hands of Drs. Westcott and Hort. The result was
obvious. When the minority, headed by Dr. Scrivener,
appealed to the chair, they found themselves confronted by a
prejudiced Advocate. They ought to have been listened to
by an impartial Judge. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">You</span></em>, my lord Bishop, are in consequence
(I regret to say) responsible for all the mischief
which has occurred. The blame of it rests at <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">your</span></em> door.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And pray disabuse yourself of the imagination that in
what precedes I have been <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">stretching</span></em> the numbers in order
to make out a case against you. It would be easy to
show that in estimating the amount of needless changes at
356 out of 836, I am greatly under the mark. I have not
included such cases, for instance, as your substitution of ἡ
μνᾶ σου, Κύριε for Κύριε, ἡ μνᾶ σου (in xix. 18), and of Τοίνυν
ἀπόδοτε for Ἀπόδοτε τοίνυν (in xx. 25),<a id="noteref_902" name="noteref_902" href="#note_902"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">902</span></span></a>—only lest you
should pretend that the transposition affects the English,
and therefore <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">was</span></em> necessary. Had I desired to swell the
number I could have easily shown that fully <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">half</span></em> the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page407">[pg 407]</span><a name="Pg407" id="Pg407" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
changes you effected in the Greek Text were wholly superfluous
for the Revision of the English Translation, and therefore
were entirely without excuse.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">This</span></em>, in fact,—(give me leave to remind you in passing,)—is
the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">true</span></em> reason why, at an early stage of your proceedings,
you resolved that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">none</span></em> of the changes you introduced into
the Greek Text should find a record in your English margin.
Had <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">any</span></em> been recorded, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">all</span></em> must have appeared. And had
this been done, you would have stood openly convicted of
having utterly disregarded the <span class="tei tei-q">“Instructions”</span> you had received
from Convocation. With what face, for example, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">could</span></em> you,
(in the margin of S. Luke xv. 17,) against the words <span class="tei tei-q">“he
said,”</span>—have printed <span class="tei tei-q">“ἔφη not εἶπε”</span>? or, (at xxiv. 44,) against
the words <span class="tei tei-q">“unto them,”</span>—must you not have been ashamed
to encumber the already overcrowded margin with such an
irrelevant statement as,—<span class="tei tei-q">“πρὸς αὐτούς <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">not</span></em> αὐτοῖς”</span>?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Now, if this were all, you might reply that by my own
showing the Textual changes complained of, if they do
no good, at least do no harm. But then, unhappily, you
and your friends have not confined yourselves to colourless
readings, when silently up and down every part of the N. T.
you have introduced innovations. I open your New English
Version at random (S. John iv. 15), and invite your attention
to the first instance which catches my eye.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
You have made the Woman of Samaria <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">complain of the
length of the walk</span></em> from Sychar to Jacob's well:—<span class="tei tei-q">“Sir, give
me this water, that I thirst not, neither <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">come all the way</span></em>
hither to draw.”</span>—What has happened? For ἔρχωμαι, I
discover that you have silently substituted ΔΙέρχωμαι.
(Even διέρχωμαι has no such meaning: but let <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">that</span></em> pass.)
What then was your authority for thrusting διέρχωμαι (which
by the way is a patent absurdity) into the Text? The word
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page408">[pg 408]</span><a name="Pg408" id="Pg408" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
is found (I discover) <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in only two Greek MSS. of had character</span></em><a id="noteref_903" name="noteref_903" href="#note_903"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">903</span></span></a>
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b</span></span> א), which, being derived from a common corrupt original,
can only reckon for <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">one</span></em>: and the reasoning which is supposed
to justify this change is thus supplied by Tischendorf:—<span class="tei tei-q">“If
the Evangelist had written ἔρχ-, who would ever have
dreamed of turning it into δι-έρχωμαι?”</span>... No one,
of course, (is the obvious answer,) except the inveterate
blunderer who, some 1700 years ago, seeing ΜΗΔΕΕΡΧΩΜΑΙ
before him, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">reduplicated the antecedent</span></em> ΔΕ. The sum of the
matter is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">that</span></em>!... Pass 1700 years, and the long-since-forgotten
blunder is furbished up afresh by Drs. Westcott and
Hort,—is urged upon the wondering body of Revisers as the
undoubted utterance of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">the Spirit</span></span>,—is accepted by yourself;—finally,
(in spite of many a remonstrance from Dr. Scrivener
and his friends,) is thrust upon the acceptance of 90 millions
of English-speaking men throughout the world, as the long-lost-sight-of,
but at last happily recovered, utterance of the
<span class="tei tei-q">“Woman of Samaria!”</span>... Ἄπαγε.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Ordinary readers, in the meantime, will of course assume
that the change results from the Revisers' skill in translating,—the
advances which have been made in the study of Greek;
for no trace of the textual vagary before us survives in the
English margin.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And thus I am reminded of what I hold to be your gravest
fault of all. The rule of Committee subject to which you
commenced operations,—the Rule which re-assured the
public and reconciled the Church to the prospect of a Revised
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page409">[pg 409]</span><a name="Pg409" id="Pg409" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
New Testament,—expressly provided that, whenever the
underlying Greek Text was altered, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">such alteration should be
indicated in the margin</span></em>. This provision you entirely set at
defiance from the very first. You have <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">never</span></em> indicated in
the margin the alterations you introduced into the Greek
Text. In fact, you made so many changes,—in other words,
you seem to have so entirely lost sight of your pledge and
your compact,—that compliance with this condition would
have been simply impossible. I see not how your body is to
be acquitted of a deliberate breach of faith.

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">(c) Fatal consequences of this mistaken officiousness.</span></span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
How serious, in the meantime, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the consequences</span></em> have been,
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">they</span></em> only know who have been at the pains to examine your
work with close attention. Not only have you, on countless
occasions, thrust out words, clauses, entire sentences of
genuine Scripture,—but you have been careful that no trace
shall survive of the fatal injury which you have inflicted. I
wonder you were not afraid. Can I be wrong in deeming such
a proceeding in a high degree sinful? Has not the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Spirit</span></span>
pronounced a tremendous doom<a id="noteref_904" name="noteref_904" href="#note_904"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">904</span></span></a> against those who do such
things? Were you not afraid, for instance, to leave out
(from S. Mark vi. 11) those solemn words of our <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Saviour</span></span>,—<span class="tei tei-q">“Verily
I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for Sodom
and Gomorrha in the day of judgment, than for that city”</span>?
Surely you will not pretend to tell me that those fifteen
precious words, witnessed to as they are by <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">all the known
copies but nine</span></em>,—by the Old Latin, the Peschito and the
Philoxenian Syriac, the Coptic, the Gothic and the Æthiopic
Versions,—besides Irenæus<a id="noteref_905" name="noteref_905" href="#note_905"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">905</span></span></a> and Victor<a id="noteref_906" name="noteref_906" href="#note_906"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">906</span></span></a> of Antioch:—you
will not venture to say (will you?) that words so attested are
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page410">[pg 410]</span><a name="Pg410" id="Pg410" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
so evidently a <span class="tei tei-q">“plain and clear error,”</span> as not to deserve even
a marginal note to attest to posterity <span class="tei tei-q">“that such things
were”</span>! I say nothing of the witness of the Liturgical usage
of the Eastern Church,—which appointed these verses to be
read on S. Mark's Day:<a id="noteref_907" name="noteref_907" href="#note_907"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">907</span></span></a> nor of Theophylact,<a id="noteref_908" name="noteref_908" href="#note_908"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">908</span></span></a> nor of

antiquity</span></em>. Find me older witnesses, if you can, than the
<span class="tei tei-q">“Elders”</span> with whom Irenæus held converse,—men who must
have been contemporaries of S. John the Divine: or again,
than the old Latin, the Peschito, and the Coptic Versions.
Then, for the MSS.,—Have you studied S. Mark's Text to so
little purpose as not to have discovered that the six uncials
on which you rely are the depositories of an abominably
corrupt Recension of the second Gospel?

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But you committed a yet more deplorable error when,—without
leaving behind either note or comment of any sort,—you

must be freely admitted to be at once original and peculiar.
I will but respectfully declare that if it be indeed one of <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the

is at liberty to blot out from the Gospel such precepts of
the Incarnate <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Word</span></span>, as these: to reject, on the plea that they
are <span class="tei tei-q">“plain and clear errors,”</span> sayings attested by twelve primitive
Fathers,—half of whom lived and died before our two
oldest manuscripts (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b</span></span> and א) came into being:—If all this be
so indeed, permit me to declare that I would not exchange

which yonder sun shines down upon.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As if what goes before had not been injury enough, you
are found to have adopted the extraordinary practice of encumbering
your margin with doubts as to the Readings
which after due deliberation you had, as a body, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">retained</span></em>.
Strange perversity! You could not find room to retain a
record in your margin of the many genuine words of our
Divine <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span></span>,—His Evangelists and Apostles,—to which
Copies, Versions, Fathers lend the fullest attestation; but
you <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">could</span></em> find room for an insinuation that His <span class="tei tei-q">“Agony and
bloody sweat,”</span>—together with His <span class="tei tei-q">“Prayer on behalf of His
murderers,”</span>—<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">may</span></em> after all prove to be nothing else but
spurious accretions to the Text. And yet, the pretence for
so regarding either S. Luke xxii. 43, 44, or xxiii. 34, is confessedly
founded on a minimum of documentary evidence:
while, as has been already shown elsewhere,<a id="noteref_911" name="noteref_911" href="#note_911"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">911</span></span></a> an overwhelming
amount of ancient testimony renders it <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">certain</span></em> that not a
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page412">[pg 412]</span><a name="Pg412" id="Pg412" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
particle of doubt attaches to the Divine record of either of
those stupendous incidents.... Room could not be found,
it seems, for a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">hint</span></em> in the margin that such ghastly wounds
as those above specified had been inflicted on S. Mark vi. 11
and S. Matth. v. 44;<a id="noteref_912" name="noteref_912" href="#note_912"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">912</span></span></a> but <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">twenty-two lines</span></em> could be spared
against Rom. ix. 5 for the free ventilation of the vile
Socinian gloss with which unbelievers in every age have
sought to evacuate one of the grandest assertions of our
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Saviour's Godhead</span></span>. May I be permitted, without offence,
to avow myself utterly astonished?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Even this however is not all. The 7th of the Rules under
which you undertook the work of Revision, was, that <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the
Headings of Chapters should be revised</span></em>.”</span> This Rule you have
not only failed to comply with; but you have actually
deprived us of those headings entirely. You have thereby
done us a grievous wrong. We demand to have the headings
of our chapters back.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
You have further, without warrant of any sort, deprived
us of our <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Marginal References</span></em>. These we cannot afford to be
without. We claim that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">they</span></em> also may be restored. The
very best Commentary on Holy Scripture are they, with
which I am acquainted. They call for learned and judicious
Revision, certainly; and they might be profitably enlarged.
But they may never be taken away.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And now, my lord Bishop, if I have not succeeded in
convincing you that the Revisers not only <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">exceeded their Instructions</span></em>
in the course which they adopted with regard to
the Greek Text,”</span> but even acted in open defiance of their
Instructions; did both a vast deal <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">more</span></em> than they were
authorized to do, and also a vast deal <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">less</span></em>;—it has certainly
been no fault of mine. As for your original contention<a id="noteref_913" name="noteref_913" href="#note_913"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">913</span></span></a> that

against the Revisers of having exceeded their Instructions,—I
venture to ask, on the contrary, whether anything can
be more unreasonable (to give it no harsher name) than <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">the

There is no difficulty in accounting for the most serious
of the foregoing phenomena. They are the inevitable consequence
of your having so far succumbed at the outset to
Drs. Westcott and Hort as to permit them to communicate
bit by bit, under promise of secrecy, their own outrageous
Revised Text of the N. T. to their colleagues, accompanied
by a printed disquisition in advocacy of their own peculiar
critical views. One would have expected in the Chairman
of the Revising body, that the instant he became aware of
any such <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">manœuvre</span></span> on the part of two of the society, he
would have remonstrated with them somewhat as follows, or
at least to this effect:—
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“This cannot be permitted, Gentlemen, on any terms. We
have not been appointed to revise the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Greek Text</span></em> of the N. T.
Our one business is to revise the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Authorized English Version</span></em>,—introducing
such changes only as are absolutely necessary.
The Resolutions of Convocation are express on this head:
and it is my duty to see that they are faithfully carried out.
True, that we shall be obliged to avail ourselves of our skill
in Textual Criticism—(such as it is)—to correct <span class="tei tei-q">‘<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">plain and
clear errors</span></em>’</span> in the Greek: but <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">there</span></em> we shall be obliged to
stop. I stand pledged to Convocation on this point by my
own recent utterances. That two of our members should be
solicitous (by a side-wind) to obtain for their own singular
Revision of the Greek Text the sanction of our united body,—is
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page414">[pg 414]</span><a name="Pg414" id="Pg414" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
intelligible enough: but I should consider myself guilty
of a breach of Trust were I to lend myself to the promotion
of their object. Let me hope that I have you all with me
when I point out that on every occasion when Dr. Scrivener,
on the one hand, (who in matters of Textual Criticism is
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">facile princeps</span></span> among us,) and Drs. Westcott and Hort on the
other, prove to be irreconcileably opposed in their views,—<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">there</span></em>
the Received Greek Text must by all means be let
alone. We have agreed, you will remember, to <span class="tei tei-q">‘make <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the
current Textus Receptus the standard; departing from it only
when critical or grammatical considerations show that it is
clearly necessary</span></em>.’</span><a id="noteref_914" name="noteref_914" href="#note_914"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">914</span></span></a> It would be unreasonable, in my judgment,
that anything in the Received Text should be claimed to
be <span class="tei tei-q">‘a clear and plain error,’</span> on which those who represent the
two antagonistic schools of Criticism find themselves utterly
unable to come to any accord. In the meantime, Drs. Westcott
and Hort are earnestly recommended to submit to public
inspection that Text which they have been for twenty years
elaborating, and which for some time past has been in print.
Their labours cannot be too freely ventilated, too searchingly
examined, too generally known: but I strongly deprecate
their furtive production <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">here</span></em>. All too eager advocacy of the
novel Theory of the two accomplished Professors, I shall
think it my duty to discourage, and if need be to repress. A
printed volume, enforced by the suasive rhetoric of its two
producers, gives to one side an unfair advantage. But indeed
I must end as I began, by respectfully inviting Drs. Westcott
and Hort to remember that we meet here, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">not</span></em> in order <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">to
fabricate a new Greek Text</span></em>, but in order to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">revise our </span><span class="tei tei-q">‘Authorized
English Version.’</span></em>”</span>... Such, in substance, is the kind
of Allocution which it was to have been expected that the
Episcopal Chairman of a Revising body would address to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page415">[pg 415]</span><a name="Pg415" id="Pg415" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
his fellow-labourers the first time he saw them enter the
Jerusalem chamber furnished with the sheets of Westcott
and Hort's N. T.; especially if he was aware that those
Revisers had been individually talked over by the Editors of
the work in question, (themselves Revisionists); and perceived
that the result of the deliberations of the entire body
was in consequence, in a fair way of becoming a foregone
conclusion,—unless indeed, by earnest remonstrance, he
might be yet in time to stave off the threatened danger.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But instead of saying anything of this kind, my lord
Bishop, it is clear from your pamphlet that you made the
Theory of Drs. Westcott and Hort <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">your own Theory</span></em>; and their
Text, by necessary consequence, in the main <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">your own Text</span></em>.
You lost sight of all the pledges you had given in Convocation.
You suddenly became a partizan. Having secured the
precious advocacy of Bp. Wilberforce,—whose sentiments on
the subject you had before adopted,—you at once threw him
and them overboard.<a id="noteref_915" name="noteref_915" href="#note_915"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">915</span></span></a>... I can scarcely imagine, in a good
man like yourself, conduct more reckless,—more disappointing,—more
unintelligible. But I must hasten on.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It follows to consider the strangest feature of your
pamphlet: viz. those two-and-thirty pages (p. 43 to p. 75) in
which, descending from generals, you venture to dispute in
sixteen particulars the sentence passed upon your new Greek
Text by the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Quarterly Review</span></span>. I call this part of your
pamphlet <span class="tei tei-q">“strange,”</span> because it displays such singular inaptitude
to appreciate the force of Evidence. But in fact,
(<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">sit venia verbo</span></span>) your entire method is quite unworthy of you.
Whereas I appeal throughout to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Ancient Testimony</span></em>, you seek
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page416">[pg 416]</span><a name="Pg416" id="Pg416" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
to put me down by flaunting in my face <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Modern Opinion</span></em>.
This, with a great deal of Reiteration, proves to be literally
the sum of your contention. Thus, concerning S. Matth. i. 25,
the Quarterly Reviewer pointed out (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">suprà</span></span> pp. <a href="#Pg123" class="tei tei-ref">123-4</a>) that
the testimony of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b</span></span> א, together with that of the VIth-century
fragment <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">z</span></span>, and two cursive copies of bad character,—cannot
possibly stand against the testimony of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">all other</span></span> copies.
You plead in reply that on <span class="tei tei-q">“those two oldest manuscripts
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the vast majority of Critics set a high value</span></em>.”</span> Very likely: but
for all <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">that</span></em>, you are I suppose aware that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b</span></span> and א are two of
the most corrupt documents in existence? And, inasmuch
as they are confessedly derived from one and the same
depraved original, you will I presume allow that they may
not be adduced as two independent authorities? At all events,
when I further show you that almost all the Versions, and
literally <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">every one</span></em> of the Fathers who quote the place, (they
are <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">eighteen</span></em> in number,) are against you,—how can you possibly
think there is any force or relevancy whatever in your
self-complacent announcement,—<span class="tei tei-q">“We cannot hesitate to
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">express our agreement with Tischendorf and Tregelles</span></em> who see
in these words an interpolation derived from S. Luke. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">The
same appears to have been the judgment of Lachmann.</span></em>”</span> Do
you desire that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">that</span></em> should pass for argument?

To prolong a discussion of this nature with you, were
plainly futile. Instead of repeating what I have already
delivered—briefly indeed, yet sufficiently in detail,—I will

rightly, was Nelson's plan when he fought the battle of the
Nile. He brought his frigates, one by one, alongside those

it to be undeniably <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">this</span></em>:—That whereas the Easterns from
time immemorial, (and we with them, since Tyndale in 1534
gave us our English Version of the N. T.,) have read the
place thus:—(I set the words down in plain English, because
the issue admits of being every bit as clearly exhibited in
the vernacular, as in Greek: and because I am determined
that all who are at the pains to read the present <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Dissertation</span></span>
shall understand it also:)—Whereas, I say, we have hitherto
read the place thus,

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Great is the mystery of godliness:—God was manifest

But English readers will require to have it explained to
them at the outset, that inasmuch as ΘΕΟΣ (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">God</span></span>) is invariably
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page426">[pg 426]</span><a name="Pg426" id="Pg426" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
written <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="text-decoration: underline">ΘΣ</span></span> in manuscripts, the only difference between the
word <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">God</span></span>”</span> and the word <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">who</span></em>”</span> (ΟΣ) consists of two horizontal
strokes,—one, which distinguishes Θ from Ο; and
another similar stroke (above the letters ΘΣ) which indicates
that a word has been contracted. And further, that it was
the custom to trace these two horizontal lines so wondrous
faintly that they sometimes actually elude observation.
Throughout cod. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a</span></span>, in fact, the letter Θ is often scarcely
distinguishable from the letter Ο.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It requires also to be explained for the benefit of the same
English reader,—(and it will do learned readers no harm to
be reminded,)—that <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">mystery</span></em>”</span> (μυστήριον) being a neuter
noun, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">cannot</span></em> be followed by the masculine pronoun (ὅς),—<span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">who</span></em>.”</span>
Such an expression is abhorrent alike to Grammar
and to Logic,—is intolerable, in Greek as in English. By
consequence, ὅς (<span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">who</span></em>”</span>) is found to have been early exchanged
for ὅ (<span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">which</span></em>”</span>). From a copy so depraved, the
Latin Version was executed in the second century. Accordingly,
every known copy or quotation<a id="noteref_922" name="noteref_922" href="#note_922"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">922</span></span></a> of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the Latin</span></em> exhibits
<span class="tei tei-q">“quod.”</span> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Greek</span></em> authorities for this reading (ὅ) are few
enough. They have been specified already, viz. at page <a href="#Pg100" class="tei tei-ref">100</a>.
And with this brief statement, the reading in question might
have been dismissed, seeing that it has found no patron since
Griesbach declared against it. It was however very hotly
contended for during the last century,—Sir Isaac Newton
and Wetstein being its most strenuous advocates; and it
would be unfair entirely to lose sight of it now.

The two rival readings, however, in 1 Tim. iii. 16, are,—Θεὸς
ἐφανερώθη (<span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">God</span></span> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">was manifested</span></em>”</span>), on the one hand;

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page427">[pg 427]</span><a name="Pg427" id="Pg427" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
between whose conflicting claims we are to adjudicate. For
I request that it may be loyally admitted at the outset,—(though
it has been conveniently overlooked by the Critics
whom <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">you</span></em> follow,)—that the expression ὂς ἐφανερώθη in
Patristic quotations, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">unless it be immediately preceded by</span></em> the
word μυστήριον, is nothing to the purpose; at all events, does
not prove the thing which <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">you</span></em> are bent on proving. English
readers will see this at a glance. An Anglican divine,—with
reference to 1 Timothy iii. 16,—may surely speak of our
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Saviour</span></span> as One <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">who</span></em> was manifested in the flesh,”</span>—without
risk of being straightway suspected of employing a copy of
the English Version which exhibits <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the mystery of godliness
who</span></em>.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Ex hujusmodi locis”</span> (as Matthæi truly remarks)

Epiphanius is opposed to the reading Θεός.—Still less is it
lawful to draw the same inference from the Latin Version of
a letter of Eutherius [<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 431] in which the expression <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">qui

As for reasoning thus concerning Cyril of Alexandria, it is
demonstrably inadmissible: seeing that at the least on two
distinct occasions, this Father exhibits Θεὸς ἐφανερώθη. I am
not unaware that in a certain place, apostrophizing the
Docetæ, he says,—<span class="tei tei-q">“Ye do err, not knowing the Scriptures,
nor indeed the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">great mystery of godliness</span></em>, that is <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Christ</span></span>, who
(ὅς) <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">was manifested in the flesh, justified in the Spirit</span></em>,”</span><a id="noteref_930" name="noteref_930" href="#note_930"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">930</span></span></a>
&amp;c. &amp;c. And presently, <span class="tei tei-q">“I consider <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the mystery of godliness</span></em>
to be no other thing but the Word of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">God</span></span> the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Father</span></span>, who

nothing whatever in this to invalidate the testimony of those
other places in which Θεός actually occurs. It is logically inadmissible,
I mean, to set aside the places where Cyril is found
actually to write Θεὸς ἐφανερώθη, because in other places he
employs 1 Tim. iii. 16 less precisely; leaving it to be inferred—(which
indeed is abundantly plain)—that Θεός is always
his reading, from the course of his argument and from the
nature of the matter in hand. But to proceed.

Your <span class="tei tei-q">“inspection”</span> happens however to be <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">inaccurate</span></em> besides.
You performed your experiment unskilfully. A man
need only hold up the leaf to the light on a very brilliant
day,—as Tregelles, Scrivener, and many besides (including
your present correspondent) have done,—to be aware that
the sagitta of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">epsilon</span></span> on fol. 145<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">b</span></span> does not cover much
more than a third of the area of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">theta</span></span> on fol. 145<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">a</span></span>.

high</span></em> to have been reasonably mistaken by a careful observer
for the diameter of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">theta</span></span> (Θ). The experiment which you

nugatory therefore.

How is it, my lord Bishop, that you do not perceive that
the way to ascertain the reading of Codex <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a</span></span> at 1 Tim. iii. 16,
is,—(1) To investigate <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">not</span></em> what is found at <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the back</span></em> of the leaf,
but what is written on <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the front</span></em> of it? and (2), Not so much
to enquire what can be deciphered of the original writing by
the aid of a powerful lens <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">now</span></em>, as to ascertain what was
apparent to the eye of competent observers when the Codex
was first brought into this country, viz. 250 years ago? That
Patrick Young, the first custodian and collator of the Codex
[1628-1652], read <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="text-decoration: underline">ΘΣ</span></span>, is certain.—Young communicated the
<span class="tei tei-q">“various Readings”</span> of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a</span></span> to Abp. Ussher:—and the latter,
prior to 1653, communicated them to Hammond, who clearly
knew nothing of ΟΣ.—It is plain that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="text-decoration: underline">ΘΣ</span></span> was the reading
seen by Huish—when he sent his collation of the Codex
(made, according to Bentley, with great exactness,<a id="noteref_934" name="noteref_934" href="#note_934"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">934</span></span></a>) to Brian
Walton, who published the fifth volume of his Polyglott in
1657.—Bp. Pearson, who was very curious in such matters,
says <span class="tei tei-q">“we find not ὅς <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in any copy</span></em>,”</span>—a sufficient proof how <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">he</span></em>
read the place in 1659.—Bp. Fell, who published an edition
of the N. T. in 1675, certainly considered <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="text-decoration: underline">ΘΣ</span></span> the reading of
Cod. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a</span></span>.—Mill, who was at work on the Text of the N. T.
from 1677 to 1707, expressly declares that he saw the
remains of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="text-decoration: underline">ΘΣ</span></span> in this place.<a id="noteref_935" name="noteref_935" href="#note_935"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">935</span></span></a> Bentley, who had himself

1718:—<span class="tei tei-q">“There can be no doubt”</span> (he says) <span class="tei tei-q">“that this MS.
always exhibited <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="text-decoration: underline">ΘΣ</span></span>. Of this, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">any one may easily convince

the same time,”</span> also, (viz. about 1716) that Wetstein
acknowledged to the Rev. John Kippax,—<span class="tei tei-q">“who took it down
in writing from his own mouth,—that though the middle
stroke of the θ has been evidently retouched, yet the fine
stroke which was originally in the body of the θ is discoverable
at each end of the fuller stroke of the corrector.”</span><a id="noteref_938" name="noteref_938" href="#note_938"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">938</span></span></a>—And
Berriman himself, (who delivered a course of Lectures on the
true reading of 1 Tim. iii. 16, in 1737-8,) attests emphatically

strokes, added at the top and in the middle by the corrector
were not designed to corrupt and falsify, but to preserve and
perpetuate the true reading, which was in danger of being
lost by the decay of Time.”</span><a id="noteref_939" name="noteref_939" href="#note_939"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">939</span></span></a>—Those memorable words

kind as yourself; and fully as deserving of credit, when they
solemnly declare what they have seen:—how <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">you</span></em>, I say, after
a survey of this evidence, can gravely sit down and inform
the world that <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">there is no sufficient evidence that there was
ever a time when this reading was patent as the reading which
came from the original scribe</span></em>”</span> (p. 72):—<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">this</span></em> passes my comprehension.—It shall only be added that Bengel, who was a
very careful enquirer, had already cited the Codex Alexandrinus
as a witness for Θεός in 1734:<a id="noteref_940" name="noteref_940" href="#note_940"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">940</span></span></a>—and that Woide, the
learned and conscientious editor of the Codex, declares that
so late as 1765 he had seen traces of the θ which twenty

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
That Wetstein subsequently changed his mind, I am not
unaware. He was one of those miserable men whose visual

are shown a text which witnesses inconveniently to the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">God</span></span>-head

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page435">[pg 435]</span><a name="Pg435" id="Pg435" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
however that ten years before, (N. T. ed. 1775,) he had rested

<span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the consent of Versions, Copies, and Fathers</span></em> which exhibit the

Tregelles, Tischendorf, Westcott and Hort, and Ellicott have
announced their opinion that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="text-decoration: underline">ΘΣ</span></span> was never written at 1 Tim.
iii. 16: confessedly only because <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="text-decoration: underline">ΘΣ</span></span> is to them invisible <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">one

remains for all <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">that</span></em>, that the original reading of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a</span></span> is attested
so amply, that no sincere lover of Truth can ever hereafter
pretend to doubt it. <span class="tei tei-q">“Omnia testimonia,”</span> (my lord Bishop,)

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The sum of the matter, (as I pointed out to you on a
former occasion,<a id="noteref_945" name="noteref_945" href="#note_945"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">945</span></span></a>) is this,—That it is too late by 150 years to
contend on the negative side of this question. Nay, a famous
living Critic (long may he live!) assures us that when his
eyes were 20 years younger (Feb. 7, 1861) he actually discerned,
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">still lingering</span></em>, a faint trace of the diameter of the Θ
which Berriman in 1741 had seen so plainly. <span class="tei tei-q">“I have
examined Codex <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a</span></span> at least twenty times within as many
years”</span> (wrote Prebendary Scrivener in 1874<a id="noteref_946" name="noteref_946" href="#note_946"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">946</span></span></a>), <span class="tei tei-q">“and ... seeing
(as every one must) with my own eyes, I have always
felt convinced that it reads <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="text-decoration: underline">ΘΣ</span></span>”</span>.... For <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">you</span></em> to assert, in
reply to all this mass of positive evidence, that the reading is
<span class="tei tei-q">“indisputably”</span> ΟΣ,—and to contend that what makes this
indisputable, is the fact that behind part of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">theta</span></span> (Θ), [but
too high to mislead a skilful observer,] an <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">epsilon</span></span> stands on

inconveniently on the ridiculous. If <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">this</span></em> be your notion of

testimony of so many <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">testes oculati</span></span> seem to you to lack sufficiency.
Your notions on these subjects are, I should think,
peculiar to yourself. You even fail to see that your statement
(in Scrivener's words) is <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">not relevant to the point at

1 Tim. iii. 16, two delicate horizontal strokes in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="text-decoration: underline">ΘΣ</span></span> which
were thoroughly patent in 1628,—which could be seen
plainly down to 1737,—and which were discernible by an
expert (Dr. Woide) so late as A.D. 1765,<a id="noteref_948" name="noteref_948" href="#note_948"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">948</span></span></a>—have for the
last hundred years entirely disappeared; which is precisely
what Berriman (in 1741) predicted would be the case. Moreover,
he solemnly warned men against drawing from this
circumstance the mistaken inference which <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">you</span></em>, my lord
Bishop, nevertheless <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">insist</span></em> on drawing, and representing as

I have treated so largely of the reading of the Codex

That א reads ΟΣ is admitted.—Not so Codex <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">c</span></span>, which the
excessive application of chemicals has rendered no longer
decipherable in this place. Tischendorf (of course) insists,
that the original reading was ΟΣ.<a id="noteref_949" name="noteref_949" href="#note_949"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">949</span></span></a> Wetstein and Griesbach
(just as we should expect,) avow the same opinion,—Woide,

original reading was <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="text-decoration: underline">ΘΣ</span></span>. As in the case of cod. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a</span></span>, it is too
late by full 100 years to re-open this question. Observable
it is that the witnesses yield contradictory evidence. Wetstein,
writing 150 years ago, before the original writing had
become so greatly defaced,—(and Wetstein, inasmuch as he
collated the MS. for Bentley [1716], must have been
thoroughly familiar with its contents,)—only <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">thought</span></em>”</span> that
he read ΟΣ; <span class="tei tei-q">“because the delicate horizontal stroke which
makes Θ out of Ο,”</span> was to him <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">not apparent</span></em>.”</span><a id="noteref_950" name="noteref_950" href="#note_950"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">950</span></span></a> Woide on the
contrary was convinced that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="text-decoration: underline">ΘΣ</span></span> had been written by the first
hand: <span class="tei tei-q">“for”</span> (said he) <span class="tei tei-q">“though there <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">exists no vestige</span></em> of the
delicate stroke which out of Ο makes Θ, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the stroke written above
the letters is by the first hand</span></em>.”</span> What however to Wetstein
and to Woide was not apparent, was visible enough to
Weber, Wetstein's contemporary. And Tischendorf, so late
as 1843, expressed his astonishment that the stroke in
question had hitherto escaped the eyes of every one; <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">having
been repeatedly seen by himself</span></em>.”</span><a id="noteref_951" name="noteref_951" href="#note_951"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">951</span></span></a> He attributes it, (just as we
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page438">[pg 438]</span><a name="Pg438" id="Pg438" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
should expect) to a corrector of the MS.; partly, because of
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">its colour</span></em>, (<span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">subnigra</span></span>”</span>); partly, because of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">its inclining upwards
to the right</span></em>. And yet, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">who</span></em> sees not that an argument
derived from <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the colour</span></em> of a line which is already well-nigh
invisible, must needs be in a high degree precarious? while
Scrivener aptly points out that the cross line in Θ,—the
ninth letter further on, (which has never been questioned,)—<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">also</span></em>
<span class="tei tei-q">“ascends towards the right.”</span> The hostile evidence
collapses therefore. In the meantime, what at least is
certain is, that the subscribed musical notation indicates that
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">a thousand years ago, a word of two syllables</span></em> was read here.
From a review of all of which, it is clear that the utmost
which can be pretended is that some degree of uncertainty
attaches to the testimony of cod. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">c</span></span>. Yet, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">why</span></em> such a plea
should be either set up or allowed, I really see not—except
indeed by men who have made up their minds beforehand
that ΟΣ <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">shall be</span></em> the reading of 1 Tim. iii. 16. Let the sign of
uncertainty however follow the notation of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">c</span></span> for this
text, if you will. That cod. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">c</span></span> is an indubitable witness for ΟΣ,
I venture at least to think that no fair person will ever
any more pretend.

the stroke above the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="text-decoration: underline">ΟΣ</span></span> signify? I venture to believe that
these two codices represent a copy which originally exhibited

very often is the case in codex <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a</span></span>)—through tract of time.
The effect of this would be that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">f</span></span> and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">g</span></span> are in reality
witnesses for Θεός. Not so, you say. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">That</span></em> slanting stroke
represents the aspirate, and proves that these two codices are
witnesses for ὅς.<a id="noteref_953" name="noteref_953" href="#note_953"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">953</span></span></a> Let us look a little more closely into this
matter.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Here are two documents, of which it has been said that
they <span class="tei tei-q">“were separately derived from some early codex, in
which there was probably no interval between the words.”</span><a id="noteref_954" name="noteref_954" href="#note_954"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">954</span></span></a>
They were <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">not immediately</span></em> derived from such a codex, I
remark: it being quite incredible that two independent
copyists could have hit on the same extravagantly absurd
way of dividing the uncial letters.<a id="noteref_955" name="noteref_955" href="#note_955"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">955</span></span></a> The common archetype
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page440">[pg 440]</span><a name="Pg440" id="Pg440" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
which both employed must have been the work of a late
Western scribe every bit as licentious and as unacquainted
with Greek as themselves.<a id="noteref_956" name="noteref_956" href="#note_956"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">956</span></span></a> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">That</span></em> archetype however may
very well have been obtained from a primitive codex of the
kind first supposed, in which the words were written continuously,
as in codex <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b</span></span>. Such Manuscripts were furnished
with neither breathings nor accents: accordingly, <span class="tei tei-q">“of the
ordinary breathings or accents there are no traces”</span><a id="noteref_957" name="noteref_957" href="#note_957"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">957</span></span></a> in either
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">f</span></span> or <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">g</span></span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But then, cod. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">f</span></span> occasionally,—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">g</span></span> much oftener,—exhibits
a little straight stroke, nearly horizontal, over the initial
vowel of certain words. Some have supposed that this was
designed to represent the aspirate: but it is not so. The
proof is, that it is found <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">consistently</span></em> introduced over the same
vowels <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in the interlinear Latin</span></em>. Thus, the Latin preposition
<span class="tei tei-q">“a”</span> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">always</span></em> has the slanting stroke above it:<a id="noteref_958" name="noteref_958" href="#note_958"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">958</span></span></a> and the Latin
interjection <span class="tei tei-q">“o”</span> is furnished with the same appendage,—alike
in the Gospels and in the Epistles.<a id="noteref_959" name="noteref_959" href="#note_959"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">959</span></span></a> This observation
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page441">[pg 441]</span><a name="Pg441" id="Pg441" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
evacuates the supposed significance of the few instances
where ἃ is written <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="text-decoration: underline">Α</span></span>:<a id="noteref_960" name="noteref_960" href="#note_960"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">960</span></span></a> as well as of the much fewer places
where ὁ or ὃ are written <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="text-decoration: underline">Ο</span></span>:<a id="noteref_961" name="noteref_961" href="#note_961"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">961</span></span></a> especially when account is taken
of the many hundred occasions, (often in rapid succession,)
when nothing at all is to be seen above the <span class="tei tei-q">“ο.”</span><a id="noteref_962" name="noteref_962" href="#note_962"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">962</span></span></a> As for the
fact that ἵνα is always written <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="text-decoration: underline">Ι</span></span>ΝΑ (or ΪΝΑ),—let it only be
noted that besides ιδωμεν, ιχθυς, ισχυρος, &amp;c., Ιακωβος,
Ιωαννης, Ιουδας, &amp;c., (which are all distinguished in the
same way,)—<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Latin words also beginning with an</span></em> <span class="tei tei-q">“I”</span> are
similarly adorned,—and we become convinced that the little
stroke in question is to be explained on some entirely
different principle. At last, we discover (from the example
of <span class="tei tei-q">“sī,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“sīc,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“etsī,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“servītus,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“saeculīs,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“idolīs,”</span> &amp;c.) that the
supposed sign of the rough breathing <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">is nothing else but
an ancient substitute for the modern dot over the </span><span class="tei tei-q">“I.”</span></em>—We may
now return to the case actually before us.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It has been pointed out that the line above the ΟΣ in both
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">f</span></span> and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">g</span></span> <span class="tei tei-q">“is not horizontal, but rises a little towards the
right.”</span> I beg to call attention to the fact that there are 38
instances of the slight super-imposed <span class="tei tei-q">“line”</span> here spoken of, in
the page of cod. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">f</span></span> where the reading under discussion
appears: 7 in the Greek, 31 in the Latin. In the corresponding
page of cod. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">g</span></span>, the instances are 44: 8 in the
Greek, 36 in the Latin.<a id="noteref_963" name="noteref_963" href="#note_963"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">963</span></span></a> These short horizontal strokes
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page442">[pg 442]</span><a name="Pg442" id="Pg442" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
(they can hardly be called <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">lines</span></em>) generally—not by any
means always—slant upwards; and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">they are invariably the
sign of contraction</span></em>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The problem before us has in this way been divested of a
needless encumbrance. The suspicion that the horizontal
line above the word ΟΣ may possibly represent the aspirate,
has been disposed of. It has been demonstrated that
throughout these two codices a horizontal line slanting upwards,
set over a vowel, is either—(1) The sign of contraction;
or else—(2) A clerical peculiarity. In the place
before us, then, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">which</span></em> of the two is it?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">The sign of contraction</span></em>, I answer: seeing that whereas
there are, in the page before us, 9 aspirated, and (including
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="text-decoration: underline">ΟΣ</span></span>) 8 contracted Greek words, not one of those <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">nine</span></em> aspirated
words has <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">any mark at all</span></em> above its initial letter; while
every one of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">eight</span></em> contracted words is duly furnished
with the symbol of contraction. I further submit that inasmuch
as ὅς is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">nowhere</span></em> else written <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="text-decoration: underline">ΟΣ</span></span> in either codex, it is unreasonable
to assume that it is so written in this place. Now,
that almost every codex in the world reads <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="text-decoration: underline">ΘΣ</span></span> in 1 Tim. iii.
16,—is a plain fact; and that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="text-decoration: underline">ΟΣ</span></span> (in verse 16) <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">would be</span></em> Θεός
if the delicate horizontal stroke which distinguishes Θ from
Ο, were not away,—no one denies. Surely, therefore, the
only thing which remains to be enquired after, is,—Are there
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">any other</span></em> such substitutions of one letter for another discoverable
in these two codices? And it is notorious that
instances of the phenomenon abound. The letters Σ, Ε, Ο, Θ
are confused throughout.<a id="noteref_964" name="noteref_964" href="#note_964"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">964</span></span></a> And what else are ΠΕΝΟΟΥΝΤΕΣ
for πενθουντες (Matth. v. 4),—ΕΚΡΙΖΩΟΗΤΙ for εκριζωθητι
(Luc. xvii. 16),—ΚΑΤΑΒΗΟΙ for καταβηθι (xix. 6),—but
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page443">[pg 443]</span><a name="Pg443" id="Pg443" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
instances of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">self-same mistake</span></em> which (as I contend) has
in this place turned <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="text-decoration: underline">ΘΣ</span></span> into <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="text-decoration: underline">ΟΣ</span></span>?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
My lord Bishop, I have submitted to all this painful
drudgery, not, you may be sure, without a sufficient reason.
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Never any more must we hear of </span><span class="tei tei-q">“breathings”</span><span style="font-style: italic"> in connexion with

has been proved to be <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">probably the sign of contraction</span></em>. I
forbear, of course, to insist that the two codices are witnesses
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">on my side</span></em>. I require that you, in the same spirit of fairness,
will abstain from claiming them as certainly witnessing <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">on
yours</span></em>. The Vth-century codex <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">c</span></span>, and the IXth-century
codex <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">f-g</span></span> must be regarded as equivocal in the testimony
they render, and are therefore not to be reckoned to either
of the contending parties.

These are many words about the two singularly corrupt
IXth-century documents, concerning which so much has
been written already. But I sincerely desire,—(and so I
trust do you, as a Christian Bishop,)—to see the end of a

has never before been fully stated. I dismiss those two
codices with the trite remark that they are, at all events, but
one codex: and that against them are to be set <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">k l p</span></span>,—<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
About the reading of <span class="tei tei-q">“Paul 17,”</span> (the notorious <span class="tei tei-q">“33”</span> of the
Gospels,) there is indeed no doubt.—Mindful however of
President Routh's advice to me always <span class="tei tei-q">“to verify my references,”</span>—concerning
<span class="tei tei-q">“Paul 73”</span> I wrote a letter of enquiry to
Upsala (July 28, 1879), and for all answer (Sept. 6th)
received a beautiful tracing of what my correspondent called
the <span class="tei tei-q">“1 Thim. iii. 16 <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">paraphe</span></span>.”</span> It proved to be an abridged
exhibition of 21 lines of Œcumenius. I instantly wrote to
enquire whether this was really all that the codex in question
has to say to 1 Tim. iii. 16? but to this I received no reply.
I presumed therefore that I had got to the bottom of the
business. But in July 1882, I addressed a fresh enquiry to
Dr. Belsheim of Christiania, and got his answer last October.
By that time he had visited Upsala: had verified for me
readings in other MSS., and reported that the reading here is
ὅς. I instantly wrote to enquire whether he had seen the
word with his own eyes? He replied that he desired to
look further into <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">this</span></em> matter on some future occasion,—the
MS. in question being (he says) a difficult one to handle.
I am still awaiting his final report, which he promises to
send me when next he visits Upsala. (<span class="tei tei-q">“Aurivillius”</span> says
nothing about it.) Let <span class="tei tei-q">“Paul 73”</span> in the meantime stand
with a note of interrogation, or how you will.

About <span class="tei tei-q">“Paul 181,”</span> (which Scholz describes as <span class="tei tei-q">“vi. 36”</span> in

a foot-note) what (in a letter to Dr. Scrivener) I explained
in the <span class="tei tei-q">“Guardian”</span> ten years ago.<a id="noteref_965" name="noteref_965" href="#note_965"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">965</span></span></a> In consequence however

the learned custos of the Laurentian library on the subject;
stating the entire case and reminding him of my pertinacity
in 1871. He replies,—<span class="tei tei-q">“Scholz fallitur huic bibliothecæ

On a review of what goes before, I submit that one
who has taken so much pains with the subject does not
deserve to be flouted as I find myself flouted by the Bp. of
Gloucester and Bristol,—who has not been at the pains to
verify <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">one single point</span></em> in this entire controversy for himself.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Every other known copy of S. Paul's Epistles</span></em>, (written in
the cursive character,) I have ascertained (by laborious
correspondence with the chiefs of foreign libraries) concurs in
exhibiting Θεὸς ἐφανερώθη ἐν σαρκί. The importance of this
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page446">[pg 446]</span><a name="Pg446" id="Pg446" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
testimony ought to be supremely evident to yourself who
contend so strenuously for the support of Paul 73 and 181.
But because, in my judgment, this practical unanimity of
the manuscripts is not only <span class="tei tei-q">“important”</span> but <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">conclusive</span></em>, I
shall presently recur to it (viz. at pages <a href="#Pg494" class="tei tei-ref">494-5</a>,) more in detail.
For do but consider that these copies were one and all derived
from yet older MSS. than themselves; and that the
remote originals of those older MSS. were perforce of higher
antiquity still, and were executed in every part of primitive
Christendom. How is it credible that they should, one and
all, conspire to mislead? I cannot in fact express better
than Dr. Berriman did 140 years ago, the logical result of
such a concord of the copies:—<span class="tei tei-q">“From whence can it be
supposed that this general, I may say this universal consent
of the Greek MSS. should arise, but from hence,—That
Θεός is the genuine original reading of this Text?”</span> (p. 325.)

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the meantime, you owe me a debt of gratitude: for, in
the course of an enquiry which I have endeavoured to make
exhaustive, I have discovered <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">three</span></em> specimens of the book
called <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Apostolus</span></span>,”</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Praxapostolus</span></span>”</span> (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> Lections from

At Tusculum, near Rome,—(the locality which Cicero
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page447">[pg 447]</span><a name="Pg447" id="Pg447" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
rendered illustrious, and where he loved to reside surrounded
by his books,)—was founded early in the XIth century a
Christian library which in process of time became exceedingly
famous. It retains, in fact, its ancient reputation to this
day. Nilus <span class="tei tei-q">“Rossanensis”</span> it was, who, driven with his monks
from Calabria by invading hordes, established in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1004 a
monastery at Tusculum, to which either he, or his successors,
gave the name of <span class="tei tei-q">“Crypta Ferrata.”</span> It became the headquarters
of the Basilian monks in the XVIIth century.
Hither habitually resorted those illustrious men, Sirletus,
Mabillon, Zacagni, Ciampini, Montfaucon,—and more lately
Mai and Dom Pitra. To Signor Cozza-Luzi, the present learned
and enlightened chief of the Vatican library, (who is himself
<span class="tei tei-q">“Abbas Monachorum Basiliensium Cryptæ Ferratæ,”</span>) I am
indebted for my copy of the Catalogue (now in process of
publication<a id="noteref_968" name="noteref_968" href="#note_968"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">968</span></span></a>) of the extraordinary collection of MSS. belonging
to the society over which he presides.

whom I cannot sufficiently thank for his courtesy and kindness.
The sum of the matter is briefly this:—There are
still preserved in the library of the Basilian monks of Crypta

<span class="tei tei-q">“Turning to the ancient Versions”</span> (you assert) <span class="tei tei-q">“we find
them almost unanimous against Θεός”</span> (p. 65). But your
business, my lord Bishop, was to show that some of them
witness <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in favour of</span></em> ὅς. If you cannot show that several
ancient Versions,—besides a fair proportion of ancient Fathers,—are
clearly on your side, your contention is unreasonable
as well as hopeless. What then do the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Versions</span></span> say?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">a</span></span>) Now, it is allowed on all hands that the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Latin</span></span> Version
was made from copies which must have exhibited μυστήριον
ὅ ἐφανερώθη. The agreement of the Latin copies is
absolute. The Latin Fathers also conspire in reading
<span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">mysterium quod</span></span>:”</span> though some of them seem to have
regarded <span class="tei tei-q">“quod”</span> as a conjunction. Occasionally, (as by the
Translator of Origen,<a id="noteref_971" name="noteref_971" href="#note_971"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">971</span></span></a>) we even find <span class="tei tei-q">“quia”</span> substituted <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">for</span></em>
<span class="tei tei-q">“quod.”</span> Estius conjectures that <span class="tei tei-q">“quod”</span> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">is</span></em> a conjunction in
this place. But in fact the reasoning of the Latin Fathers is
observed invariably to proceed as if they had found nothing
else but <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Deus</span></span>”</span> in the text before them. They bravely
assume that the Eternal <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Word</span></span>, the second Person in the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page449">[pg 449]</span><a name="Pg449" id="Pg449" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Trinity, is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">designated</span></em> by the expression <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">magnum pietatis
sacramentum</span></span>.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">b</span></span>) It is, I admit, a striking circumstance that such a
mistake as this in the old Latin should have been retained in
the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Vulgate</span></span>. But if you ever study this subject with attention,
you will find that Jerome,—although no doubt he <span class="tei tei-q">“professedly
corrected the old Latin Version by the help of
ancient Greek manuscripts,”</span> (p. 69,)—on many occasions
retains readings which it is nevertheless demonstrable that
he individually disapproved. No certain inference therefore
as to what Jerome <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">found</span></em> in ancient Greek MSS. can be
safely drawn from the text of the Vulgate.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">c</span></span>) Next, for the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Syriac</span></em> (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Peschito</span></span>) Version. I beg to
subjoin the view of the late loved and lamented P. E. Pusey,—the
editor of Cyril, and who at the time of his death was
engaged in re-editing the Peschito. He says,—<span class="tei tei-q">“In 1 Tim.
iii. 16, the Syriac has <span class="tei tei-q">‘<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">qui manifestatus est</span></span>.’</span> The relative is
indeterminate, but the verb is not. In Syriac however
μυστήριον is masculine; and thus, the natural way would be
to take μυστήριον as the antecedent, and translate <span class="tei tei-q">‘<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">quod
manifestatum est</span></span>.’</span> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">No one would have thought of any other
way of translating the Syriac</span></em>—but for the existence of the
various reading ὅς in the Greek, and the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">possibility</span></em> of its
affecting the translation into Syriac. But the Peschito is so
really a translation into good Syriac, (not into word-for-word
Syriac,) that if the translator had wanted to express the
Greek ὅς, in so difficult a passage, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">he would have turned it
differently</span></em>.”</span><a id="noteref_972" name="noteref_972" href="#note_972"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">972</span></span></a>—The Peschito therefore yields the same
testimony as the Latin; and may not be declared (as you
declare it) to be indeterminate. Still less may it be
represented as witnessing to ὅς.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">d</span></span>) It follows to enquire concerning the rendering of
1 Tim. iii. 16 in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Philoxenian</span></span>, or rather the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Harkleian</span></span>
Version (VIIth cent.), concerning which I have had recourse
to the learned Editor of that Version. He writes:—<span class="tei tei-q">“There
can be no doubt that the authors of this Version had either
Θεός or Θεοῦ before them: while their marginal note shows
that they were aware of the reading ὅς. They exhibit,—<span class="tei tei-q">‘<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Great

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Now this introduction of the word Θεός into the text,
however inartistic it may seem to you and to me, is a fatal
circumstance to those who would contend on your side. It
shows translators divided between two rival and conflicting
readings: but determined to give prominence to the circumstance
which constituted the greatness of the mystery: viz.
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">God incarnate</span></span>. <span class="tei tei-q">“May I suggest”</span> (adds the witty scholar
in his Post-script) <span class="tei tei-q">“that there would be no mystery in <span class="tei tei-q">‘a

The facts concerning the Harkleian Version being such,
you will not be surprised to hear me say that I am at a loss
to understand how, without a syllable expressive of doubt,
you should claim this version (the <span class="tei tei-q">“Philoxenian”</span> you call it—but
it is rather the Harkleian), as a witness on your side,—a
witness for ὅς.<a id="noteref_974" name="noteref_974" href="#note_974"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">974</span></span></a> It not only witnesses <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">against</span></em> you, (for
the Latin and the Peschito do <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">that</span></em>,) but, as I have shown
you, it is a witness on <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">my</span></em> side.

<span class="tei tei-q">“We are content”</span> (you say) to <span class="tei tei-q">“refer our readers to
Tischendorf and Tregelles, who unhesitatingly claim the
Memphitic [or Coptic] and the Thebaic [or Sahidic] for ὅς.”</span><a id="noteref_975" name="noteref_975" href="#note_975"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">975</span></span></a>
But surely, in a matter of this kind, my lord Bishop—(I
mean, when we are discussing some nicety of a language of
which personally we know absolutely nothing,)—we may
never <span class="tei tei-q">“be content to refer our readers”</span> to individuals who
are every bit as ignorant of the matter as ourselves. Rather
should we be at the pains to obtain for those whom we propose
to instruct the deliberate verdict of those who have
made the subject their special study. Dr. Malan (who must
be heartily sick of me by this time), in reply to my repeated
enquiries, assures me that in Coptic and in Sahidic alike,
<span class="tei tei-q">“the relative pronoun always takes the gender of the Greek
antecedent. But, inasmuch as there is properly speaking
no neuter in either language, the masculine does duty <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">for</span></em>
the neuter; the gender of the definite article and relative
pronoun being determined by the gender of the word
referred to. Thus, in S. John xv. 26, the Coptic <span class="tei tei-q">‘<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">pi</span></span>’</span> and
<span class="tei tei-q">‘<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">phè</span></span>’</span> respectively represent the definite article and the
relative, alike in the expression ὁ Παράκλητος ὅν, and in the
expression τὸ Πνεῦμα ὅ: and so throughout. In 1 Tim. iii.
16, therefore, <span class="tei tei-q">‘<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">pi mustèrion phè</span></span>,’</span> must perforce be rendered, τὸ
μυστήριον ὅ:—not, surely, ὁ μυστήριον ὅς. And yet, if <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the relative</span></em>
may be masculine, why not <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the article</span></em> also? But in fact,
we have no more right to render the Coptic (or the Sahidic)
relative by ὅς in 1 Tim. iii. 16, than in any other similar passage
where a neuter noun (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">e.g.</span></span> πνεῦμα or σῶμα) has gone
before. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">In this particular case</span></em>, of course a pretence may be
set up that the gender of the relative shall be regarded as
an open question: but in strictness of grammar, it is far
otherwise. No Coptic or Sahidic scholar, in fact, having
to translate the Coptic or Sahidic back into Greek,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page452">[pg 452]</span><a name="Pg452" id="Pg452" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">you are mistaken</span></em> in your statement (p. 69),—that <span class="tei tei-q">“Ὅς
is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">supported by the two Egyptian Versions</span></em>.”</span> It is supported
by <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">neither</span></em>. You have been shown that they both witness
against you. You will therefore not be astonished to hear
me again declare that I am at a loss to understand how you

you not at once communicate the precious secret to mankind,
and thereby save us all a world of trouble?

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
You will perhaps propose to fall back on Hort's wild
theory of a <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Syrian Text</span></em>,”</span>—executed by authority at Antioch
somewhere between <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 250 and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 350.<a id="noteref_982" name="noteref_982" href="#note_982"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">982</span></span></a> Be it so.

that fable be argued upon as if it were a fact. And what
follows? That <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">at a period antecedent to the date of any existing

capacity declared Θεός (not ὅς) to be the true reading of
1 Tim. iii. 16.

Only one other head of Evidence (the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Patristic</span></span>) remains
to be explored; after which, we shall be able to sum up,

It only remains to ascertain what the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Fathers</span></span> have to
say on this subject. And when we turn our eyes in this direction,
we are encountered by a mass of evidence which effectually
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page456">[pg 456]</span><a name="Pg456" id="Pg456" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
closes this discussion. You contended just now as
eagerly for the Vth-century Codex <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a</span></span>, as if its witness were
a point of vital importance to you. But I am prepared to
show that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Gregory of Nyssa</span></span> (a full century before Codex <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a</span></span>
was produced), in at least 22 places, knew of no other reading
but Θεός.<a id="noteref_983" name="noteref_983" href="#note_983"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">983</span></span></a> Of his weighty testimony you appear to have
been wholly unaware in 1869, for you did not even mention
Gregory by name (see p. <a href="#Pg429" class="tei tei-ref">429</a>). Since however you now admit
that his evidence is unequivocally against you, I am willing
to hasten forward,—only supplying you (at foot) with the
means of verifying what I have stated above concerning
the testimony of this illustrious Father.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
You are besides aware that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Didymus</span></span>,<a id="noteref_984" name="noteref_984" href="#note_984"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">984</span></span></a> another illustrious
witness, is against you; and that he delivers unquestionable
testimony.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
You are also aware that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Theodoret</span></span>,<a id="noteref_985" name="noteref_985" href="#note_985"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">985</span></span></a> in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">four</span></em> places, is
certainly to be reckoned on the same side:
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page457">[pg 457]</span><a name="Pg457" id="Pg457" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And further, that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">John Damascene</span></span><a id="noteref_986" name="noteref_986" href="#note_986"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">986</span></span></a> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">twice</span></em> adds his
famous evidence to the rest,—and is also against you.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Chrysostom</span></span><a id="noteref_987" name="noteref_987" href="#note_987"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">987</span></span></a> again, whose testimony you called in question
in 1869, you now admit is another of your opponents.
I will not linger over his name therefore,—except to remark,
that how you can witness a gathering host of ancient Fathers
illustrious as these, without misgiving, passes my comprehension.
Chrysostom is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">three</span></em> times a witness.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Next come two quotations from <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Gregory of Nazianzus</span></span>,—which
I observe you treat as <span class="tei tei-q">“inconclusive.”</span> I retain
them all the same.<a id="noteref_988" name="noteref_988" href="#note_988"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">988</span></span></a> You are reminded that this most
rhetorical of Fathers is seldom more precise in quoting
Scripture.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And to the same century which Gregory of Nazianzus
adorned, is probably to be referred,—(it cannot possibly be
later than <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 350, though it may be a vast deal more
ancient,)—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">the title</span></span> bestowed, in the way of summary, on
that portion of S. Paul's first Epistle to Timothy which is
contained between chap. iii. 16 and chap. iv. 7,—viz., Περὶ

of the <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Euthalian</span></span>”</span> κεφάλαια or chapters: but Euthalius himself
declares that those 18 titles were <span class="tei tei-q">“devised by a certain very
wise and pious Father;”</span><a id="noteref_989" name="noteref_989" href="#note_989"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">989</span></span></a> and this particular title (Περὶ θείας
σαρκώσεως) is freely employed and discussed in Gregory of
Nyssa's treatise against Apolinaris,<a id="noteref_990" name="noteref_990" href="#note_990"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">990</span></span></a>—which latter had, in
fact, made it part of the title of his own heretical treatise.<a id="noteref_991" name="noteref_991" href="#note_991"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">991</span></span></a>
That the present is a very weighty attestation of the reading,
ΘΕῸΣ ἐφανερώθη ἐν ΣΑΡΚΊ no one probably will deny: a
memorable proof moreover that Θεός<a id="noteref_992" name="noteref_992" href="#note_992"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">992</span></span></a> must have been universally
read in 1 Tim. iii. 16 throughout the century which
witnessed the production of codices <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b</span></span> and א.

from 1 Tim. iii. 16.<a id="noteref_993" name="noteref_993" href="#note_993"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">993</span></span></a>

attempt to detract from the importance of their testimony
by screwing down their date <span class="tei tei-q">“to the sticking place:”</span>—your
assertion that the testimony of a fifth Father <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">is not

of a sixth may <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">perhaps</span></em>”</span> be inadmissible:—all this kind of
thing is not only quite unworthy of a Bishop when he turns
disputant, but effectually indisposes his opponent to receive
his argumentation with that respectful deference which else
would have been undoubtedly its due.

old do you suppose were the sacred codices he had employed

infinitely more important) than that of any written codex

<span class="tei tei-q">“Such as <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Euthalius</span></span>”</span>! You had evidently forgotten when
you penned that offensive sentence, that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Euthalius</span></span> is one of
the few Fathers <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">adduced by yourself</span></em><a id="noteref_998" name="noteref_998" href="#note_998"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">998</span></span></a> (but for whom you
<span class="tei tei-q">“gave no reference,”</span>) in 1869,—when you were setting down
the Patristic evidence in favour of Θεός.... This little incident
is really in a high degree suggestive. Your practice
has evidently been to appropriate Patristic references<a id="noteref_999" name="noteref_999" href="#note_999"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">999</span></span></a> without
thought or verification,—prudently to abstain from dropping
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page461">[pg 461]</span><a name="Pg461" id="Pg461" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
a hint how you came by them,—but to use them like
dummies, for show. At the end of a few years, (naturally
enough,) you entirely forget the circumstance,—and proceed
vigorously to box the ears of the first unlucky Dean who
comes in your way, whom you suspect of having come by
his learning (such as it is) in the same slovenly manner.
Forgive me for declaring (while my ears are yet tingling)
that if you were even moderately acquainted with this department
of Sacred Science, you would see at a glance that my
Patristic references are <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">never</span></em> obtained at second hand: for
the sufficient reason that elsewhere they are not to be met
with. But waiving this, you have made it <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">luce clarius</span></span> to all
the world that so late as the year 1882, to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">you</span></em> <span class="tei tei-q">“Euthalius”</span>
was nothing else but <span class="tei tei-q">“a name.”</span> And this really does astonish
me: for not only was he a famous Ecclesiastical personage,
(a Bishop like yourself,) but his work (the date of which is
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 458,) is one with which no Author of a <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Critical</span></em> Commentary”</span>
on S. Paul's Epistles can afford to be unacquainted.
Pray read what Berriman has written concerning Euthalius
(pp. 217 to 222) in his admirable <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Dissertation on</span></span> 1 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Tim.</span></span> iii.

(vol. x. 197-323), and you will recognize the plain fact
that the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">only</span></em> reason why, in the <span class="tei tei-q">“Quarterly Review,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“no

reasonable dispute. The present is in fact just the kind of
text which, from its undeniable grandeur,—its striking

It is to be wished, no doubt, that these references had been a
little more full and explicit: but the very early Fathers are
ever observed to quote Scripture thus partially,—allusively,—elliptically.

(2) <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Barnabas</span></span> has just such another allusive reference to
the words in dispute, which seems to show that he must have

Once, while engaged in proving that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Christ</span></span> is <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">God</span></span>, he
says:—Οὗτος προελθὼν εἰς κόσμον Θεὸς ἐν σώματι ἐφανερώθη:<a id="noteref_1006" name="noteref_1006" href="#note_1006"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1006</span></span></a>—and
again, in a very similar passage which Theodoret
quotes from the same Father's lost work on the
Psalms:—Οὗτος ὁ προελθὼν εἰς τὸν κόσμον, Θεὸς καὶ ἄνθρωπος
ἐφανερώθη.<a id="noteref_1007" name="noteref_1007" href="#note_1007"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1007</span></span></a>—(4) <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Gregory Thaumaturgus</span></span>, (if it really be he,)
seems also to refer directly to this place when he says (in a

You are requested to observe that in order to prevent cavil, I
forbear to build on two other famous places in Cyril's writings

corresponding amount of evidence which has been discovered
for reading ὅς. Not but what the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">context</span></em> renders it plain
that Θεός must have been Cyril's word on both occasions.
Of this let the reader himself be judge:—

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(1) In a treatise, addressed to the Empresses Eudocia and
Pulcheria, Cyril quotes 1 Tim. iii. 16 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">in extenso</span></span>.<a id="noteref_1016" name="noteref_1016" href="#note_1016"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1016</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-q">“If”</span> (he

belief that Cyril wrote Θεός:—<span class="tei tei-q">“What then means
<span class="tei tei-q">‘was manifested in the flesh’</span>? It means that the Word of
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">God</span></span> the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Father</span></span> was made flesh.... In this way therefore
we say that He was both <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">God</span></span> and Man.... Thus”</span> (Cyril concludes)
<span class="tei tei-q">“is He <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">God</span></span> and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span></span> of all.”</span><a id="noteref_1020" name="noteref_1020" href="#note_1020"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1020</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But, as aforesaid, I do not propose to rest my case on either
of these passages; but on those two other places concerning
which there exists no variety of tradition as to the reading.
Whether the passages in which the reading is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">certain</span></em> ought
not to be held to determine the reading of the passages concerning
which the evidence is about evenly balanced;—whether
in doubtful cases, the requirements of the context should not
be allowed to turn the scale;—I forbear to enquire. I take
my stand on what is clear and undeniable. On the other
hand you are challenged to produce a single instance in Cyril
of μυστηριον; ὅς ἐφανερώθη, where the reading is not equally
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page467">[pg 467]</span><a name="Pg467" id="Pg467" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
balanced by μυστήριον Θεός. And (as already explained) of
course it makes nothing for ὅς that Cyril should sometimes
say that <span class="tei tei-q">“the mystery”</span> here spoken of is <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Christ</span></span> who <span class="tei tei-q">“was
manifested in the flesh,”</span> &amp;c. A man with nothing else but
the A. V. of the <span class="tei tei-q">“Textus Receptus”</span> before him might equally
well say <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">that</span></em>. See above, pages <a href="#Pg427" class="tei tei-ref">427-8</a>.

and which <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">as they quote it</span></em>, (viz. so mutilated as effectually to
conceal its meaning,) certainly seems to be express in its testimony.
But the thing is all a mistake. Rightly understood,
the Scholium in question renders no testimony at all;—as I
proceed to explain. The only wonder is that such critics as
Bentley,<a id="noteref_1022" name="noteref_1022" href="#note_1022"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1022</span></span></a> Wetstein,<a id="noteref_1023" name="noteref_1023" href="#note_1023"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1023</span></span></a> Birch,<a id="noteref_1024" name="noteref_1024" href="#note_1024"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1024</span></span></a> Tischendorf,<a id="noteref_1025" name="noteref_1025" href="#note_1025"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1025</span></span></a> or even Tregelles,<a id="noteref_1026" name="noteref_1026" href="#note_1026"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1026</span></span></a>
should not have seen this for themselves.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The author, (whether Photius, or some other,) is insisting
on our <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord's</span></span> absolute exemption from sin, although for our
sakes He became very Man. In support of this, he quotes
Is. liii. 9, (or rather, 1 Pet. ii. 22)—<span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Who did no sin, neither
was guile found in His mouth</span></em>.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“S. Cyril”</span> (he proceeds) <span class="tei tei-q">“in

our infirmities,”</span> and so on. Now, every one must see at a glance
that it is entirely to misapprehend the matter to suppose
that it is any part of the Scholiast's object, in what precedes,
to invite attention to so irrelevant a circumstance as that
Cyril began his quotation of 1 Tim. iii. 16, with ὅς instead of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page468">[pg 468]</span><a name="Pg468" id="Pg468" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

the Scholiast's one object was to show how Cyril interpreted
the expression <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">justified in the Spirit</span></em>.”</span> Altogether misleading
is it to quote <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">only the first line</span></em>, beginning at ὅς and ending at
πνεύματι, as the Critics <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">invariably</span></em> do. The point to which in
this way prominence is exclusively given, was clearly, to the
Commentator, a matter of no concern at all. He quotes from
Cyril's <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Scholia de Incarnatione Unigeniti</span></span>,”</span><a id="noteref_1029" name="noteref_1029" href="#note_1029"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1029</span></span></a> in preference to any

yet <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">this</span></em>—(viz. Cyril's supposed substitution of ὅς for Θεός)—is,
in the account of the Critics, the one thing which the
Scholiast was desirous of putting on record.

In the meanwhile, on referring to the place in Cyril, we
make an important discovery. The Greek of the Scholium
in question being lost, we depend for our knowledge of its
contents on the Latin translation of Marius Mercator, Cyril's

of either ὅς or ὅ.<a id="noteref_1031" name="noteref_1031" href="#note_1031"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1031</span></span></a> The quotation from Timothy begins

<span class="tei tei-q">“Resurrection,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Ascension,”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“Session at the Right Hand,”</span>—he
does not quote S. Mark xvi. 19. And yet,—(as it has

by Cyril himself,)—this is only because, on the previous
day, being Sunday, Cyril of Jerusalem had enlarged upon the
Scriptural evidence for those august verities, (viz. S. Mark
xvi. 19,—S. Luke xxiv. 51,—Acts i. 9); and therefore was
unwilling to say over again before the same auditory what
he had so recently delivered.

But indeed,—(the remark is worth making in passing,)—many
of our modern Critics seem to forget that the heretics
with whom Athanasius, Basil, the Gregories, &amp;c., were chiefly
in conflict, did not by any means deny the Godhead of our
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span></span>. Arians and Apolinarians alike admitted that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Christ</span></span>

differently indeed would the ancient Fathers have expressed
themselves, could they have imagined the calamitous use
which, at the end of 1500 years, perverse wits would make of
their writings,—the astonishing inferences they would propose
to extract from their very silence. I may not go further

Instead of either assenting to this, (which is surely a self-evident
proposition!),—or else disproving it,—you are at the
pains to furbish up afresh, as if it were a novelty, the stale
and stupid figment propagated by Liberatus of Carthage,
that Macedonius was expelled from his see by the Emperor
Anastasius for falsifying 1 Timothy iii. 16. This exploded
fable you preface by announcing it as <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">a remarkable fact</span></em>,”</span>
that <span class="tei tei-q">“it was the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">distinct belief of Latin writers</span></em> as early as the
VIth century that the reading of this passage had been
corrupted by the Greeks.”</span><a id="noteref_1041" name="noteref_1041" href="#note_1041"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1041</span></span></a> How you get your <span class="tei tei-q">“remarkable

by a single individual,—I see not. But let that pass.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“The story shows”</span> (you proceed) <span class="tei tei-q">“that the Latins in the
sixth century believed ὅς to be the reading of the older Greek
manuscripts, and regarded Θεός as a false reading made out
of it.”</span> (p. 69.)—My lord Bishop, I venture to declare that
the story shows nothing of the sort. The Latins in the VIth
(and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">every other</span></em>) century believed that—<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">not</span></em> ὅς, but—ὅ, was
the right reading of the Greek in this place. Their belief on
this subject however has nothing whatever to do with the
story before us. Liberatus was not the spokesman of <span class="tei tei-q">“the
Latins of the VIth,”</span> (or any other bygone) <span class="tei tei-q">“century:”</span> but (as
Bp. Pearson points out) a singularly ill-informed Archdeacon
of Carthage; who, had he taken ever so little pains with the
subject, would have become aware that for no such reason as he
assigns was Macedonius [<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 511] thrust out of his bishopric.
If, however, there were at least thus much of truth in the story,—namely,
that one of the charges brought against Macedonius
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page472">[pg 472]</span><a name="Pg472" id="Pg472" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
was his having corrupted Scripture, and notably his having
altered ὅς into Θεός in 1 Tim. iii. 16;—surely, the most
obvious of all inferences would be, that Θεός <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">was found in copies
of S. Paul's epistles put forth at Constantinople by archiepiscopal
authority between</span></em> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 496 <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">and</span></em> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 511. To say the least,—Macedonius,
by his writings or by his discourses, certainly
by his influence, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">must have shown himself favourable to</span></em> Θεός
(<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">not</span></em> ὅς) ἐφανερώθη. Else, with what show of reason could the
charge have been brought against him? <span class="tei tei-q">“I suppose”</span> (says
our learned Dr. John Mill) <span class="tei tei-q">“that the fable before us arose
out of the fact that Macedonius, on hearing that in several
MSS. of the Constantinopolitan Church the text of 1 Tim. iii.
16 (which witnesses expressly to the Godhead of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Christ</span></span>) had
been depraved, was careful that those copies should be corrected
in conformity with the best exemplars.”</span><a id="noteref_1042" name="noteref_1042" href="#note_1042"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1042</span></span></a>

But, in fact, I suspect you completely misunderstand the
whole matter. You speak of <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the</span></em> story.”</span> But pray,—<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Which</span></em>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Now, that this is a very lame story, all must see. In reciting
the passage in Latin, Liberatus himself exhibits neither <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">qui</span></span>,”</span>
nor <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">quod</span></span>,”</span> nor <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Deus</span></span>,”</span>—but <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">quia</span></span> <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">apparuit in carne</span></span>.”</span> (The

And yet, Liberatus straightway adds (as the effect of the
change) <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">ut esset Deus apparuit per carnem</span></span>:”</span> as if that were
possible, unless <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Deus</span></span>”</span> stood in the text already! Quite
plain in the meantime is it, that, according to Liberatus,
ὡς was the word which Macedonius introduced into 1 Tim.
iii. 16. And it is worth observing that the scribe who
rendered into Greek Pope Martin I.'s fifth Letter (written
on the occasion of the Lateran Council <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 649),—having
to translate the Pope's quotation from the Vulgate (<span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">quod

High time it becomes that I should offer it as my opinion
that those Critics are right (Cornelius à Lapide [1614] and
Cotelerius [1681]) who, reasoning from what Liberatus
actually says, shrewdly infer that there must have existed
codices in the time of Macedonius which exhibited ΟΣ ΘΕΟΣ
in this place; and that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">this</span></em> must be the reading to which
Liberatus refers.<a id="noteref_1047" name="noteref_1047" href="#note_1047"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1047</span></span></a> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Such codices exist still.</span></em> One, is preserved

Enough of all this however. Too much in fact. I must

I hold it to be of superlative importance. It transports us
back, at once, to the primitive age; and is found to be

why? For the plain reason that it must needs have been

popular with the Socinian party down to the third quarter of

No one may presume to speak slightingly of such evidence
as this. It is the oldest which can be produced for the
truth of anything in the inspired Text of the New Testament;
and it comes from the East as well as from the West.
Yet is it, in and by itself, clearly inadequate. Two characteristics
of Truth are wanting to it,—two credentials,—unfurnished
with which, it cannot be so much as seriously
entertained. It demands <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Variety</span></em> as well as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Largeness of

how, on such evidence, the Critics of the last century can
have persuaded themselves (with Grotius) that μυστήριον; ὅ
ἐφανερώθη is the true reading of 1 Timothy iii. 16. And yet,
in order to maintain this thesis, Sir Isaac Newton descended
from the starry sphere and tried his hand at Textual Criticism.
Wetstein (1752) freely transferred the astronomer's
labours to his own pages, and thus gave renewed currency to
an opinion which the labours of the learned Berriman (1741)
had already <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">demonstrated</span></em> to be untenable.

wrote ὅς or ὅ, must remain uncertain till a sight has
been obtained of his Greek together with its context. I find
that he quotes 1 Tim iii. 16 at least three times:—Of the
first place, there is only a Latin translation, which begins

comes to us in Latin, Greek, and Syriac: but unsatisfactorily

quotation thus,—<span class="tei tei-q">“Consonantia et Apostolus dicit, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Et manifeste

the Peschito by substituting a different word for εὐσέβεια,
and by employing the emphatic state <span class="tei tei-q">“the-flesh,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“the-spirit”</span>
where the Peschito has the absolute state <span class="tei tei-q">“flesh,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“spirit.”</span>

find it difficult from all this to know what precisely
to do with Theodore's evidence. It has a truly
oracular ambiguity; wavering between ὅ—ὅς—and even
Θεός. You, I observe, (who are only acquainted with the
second of the three places above cited, and but imperfectly
with <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">that</span></em>,) do not hesitate to cut the knot by simply
claiming the heretic's authority for the reading you advocate,—viz.
ὅς. I have thought it due to my readers to tell
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page482">[pg 482]</span><a name="Pg482" id="Pg482" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
them all that is known about the evidence furnished by
Theodore of Mopsuestia. At all events, the utmost which
can be advanced in favour of reading μυστήριον; ὅ in 1
Timothy iii. 16, has now been freely stated. I am therefore
at liberty to pass on to the next opinion.

Remarkable it is how completely Griesbach succeeded in
diverting the current of opinion with respect to the place before
us, into a new channel. At first indeed (viz. in 1777) he
retained Θεός in his Text, timidly printing ὅς in small type
above it; and remarking,—<span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Judicium de hâc lectionis varietate
lectoribus liberum relinquere placuit</span></span>.”</span> But, at the end of
thirty years (viz. in 1806), waxing bolder, Griesbach substituted
ὅς for Θεός,—<span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">ut ipsi</span></span>”</span> (as he says) <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">nobis constaremus</span></span>.”</span>
Lachmann, Tischendorf, Tregelles, Westcott and Hort, and
the Revisers, under your guidance, have followed him:
which is to me unaccountable,—seeing that even less authority
is producible for ὅς, than for ὅ, in this place. But let
the evidence for μυστήριον; ὅς ἐφανερώθη ἐν σαρκί be briefly
recapitulated:—
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(α) It consists of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">a single uncial copy</span></em>, viz. the corrupt cod.

Paul 17, (the notorious <span class="tei tei-q">“33”</span> of the Gospels,)—and a copy
at Upsala (No. 73), which is held to require further verification.<a id="noteref_1080" name="noteref_1080" href="#note_1080"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1080</span></span></a>
To these, are to be added three other liturgical witnesses
in the cursive character—being Western copies of the
book called <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Apostolus</span></span>,”</span> which have only recently come to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page483">[pg 483]</span><a name="Pg483" id="Pg483" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

(β) <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">The only Version</span></em> which certainly witnesses in favour

evidence of a single copy in the Ambrosian library.

Behold then the provision which <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">the Author</span></span> of Scripture
has made for the effectual conservation in its integrity of this
portion of His written Word! Upwards of eighteen hundred
years have run their course since the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Holy Ghost</span></span> by His
servant, Paul, rehearsed the <span class="tei tei-q">“mystery of Godliness;”</span> declaring
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">this</span></em> to be the great foundation-fact,—namely, that <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">God was
manifested in the flesh</span></span>.”</span> And lo, out of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">two hundred and
fifty-four</span></em> copies of S. Paul's Epistles no less than <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">two hundred
and fifty-two</span></em> are discovered to have preserved that expression.
Such <span class="tei tei-q">“Consent”</span> amounts to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Unanimity</span></em>; and, (as I explained
at pp. <a href="#Pg454" class="tei tei-ref">454-5</a>,) unanimity in this subject-matter, is conclusive.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The copies of which we speak, (you are requested to observe,)
were produced in every part of ancient Christendom,—being
derived in every instance from copies older than themselves;
which again were transcripts of copies older still.
They have since found their way, without design or contrivance,
into the libraries of every country of Europe,—where,
for hundreds of years they have been jealously
guarded. And,—(I repeat the question already hazarded at
pp. <a href="#Pg445" class="tei tei-ref">445-6</a>, and now respectfully propose it to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">you</span></em>, my

lord Bishop; requesting you at your convenience to favour

can this multitude of witnesses be supposed to have entered
into a wicked conspiracy to deceive mankind?

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
True, that no miracle has guarded the sacred Text in this,
or in any other place. On the other hand, for the last 150
years, Unbelief has been carping resolutely at this grand
proclamation of the Divinity of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Christ</span></span>,—in order to prove
that not this, but some other thing, it must have been,
which the Apostle wrote. And yet (as I have fully shown)
the result of all the evidence procurable is to establish that
the Apostle must be held to have written no other thing
but <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">this</span></em>.

To the overwhelming evidence thus furnished by 252 out

the evidence supplied by the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Lectionaries</span></em>. It has been already
explained (viz. at pp. <a href="#Pg477" class="tei tei-ref">477-8</a>) that out of 32 copies of the
<span class="tei tei-q">“Apostolus,”</span> 29 concur in witnessing to Θεός. I have just
(May 7th) heard of another in the Vatican.<a id="noteref_1103" name="noteref_1103" href="#note_1103"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1103</span></span></a> To these 30,
should be added the 3 Liturgical codices referred to at pp.

of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ancient Ecclesiastical Tradition</span></em>. The numerical result of

In all that precedes, I have abstained from pleading
the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">probabilities</span></em> of the case; and for a sufficient reason.
Men's notions of what is <span class="tei tei-q">“probable”</span> are observed to differ
so seriously. <span class="tei tei-q">“Facile intelligitur”</span> (says Wetstein) <span class="tei tei-q">“lectiones
ὅς et Θεός esse interpretamenta pronominis ὅ: sed nec ὅ
nec ὅς posse esse interpretamentum vocis Θεός.”</span> Now, I
should have thought that the exact reverse is as clear as
the day. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">What</span></em> more obvious than that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="text-decoration: underline">ΘΣ</span></span>, by exhibiting
indistinctly either of its delicate horizontal strokes, (and
they were often so traced as to be scarcely discernible,<a id="noteref_1111" name="noteref_1111" href="#note_1111"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1111</span></span></a>) would
become mistaken for ΟΣ? What more natural again than
that the masculine relative should be forced into agreement
with its neuter antecedent? Why, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the thing has actually
happened</span></em> at Coloss. i. 27; where ὍΣ ἐστι Χριστός has been
altered into ὅ, only because μυστήριον is the antecedent.
But waiving this, the internal evidence in favour of Θεός
must surely be admitted to be overwhelming, by all save
one determined that the reading <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">shall be</span></em> ὅς or ὅ. I trust we
are at least agreed that the maxim <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">proclivi lectioni præstat
ardua</span></span>,”</span> does not enunciate so foolish a proposition as that
in choosing between two or more conflicting readings, we
are to prefer <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">that</span></em> one which has the feeblest external
attestation,—provided it be but in itself almost unintelligible?

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And yet, in the present instance,—How (give me leave to
ask) will you translate? To those who acquiesce in the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page498">[pg 498]</span><a name="Pg498" id="Pg498" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
notion that the μέγα μυστήριον τῆς εὐσεβείας means our
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Saviour Christ</span></span> Himself, (consider Coloss. i. 27,) it is obvious
to translate <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">who</span></em>:”</span> yet how harsh, or rather how intolerable
is this! I should have thought that there could be no real
doubt that <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the mystery</span></em>”</span> here spoken of must needs be
that complex exhibition of Divine condescension which
the Apostle proceeds to rehearse in outline: and of which
the essence is that it was very and eternal <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">God</span></span> who was the
subject of the transaction. Those who see this, and yet
adopt the reading ὅς, are obliged to refer it to the remote
antecedent Θεός. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">You</span></em> do not advocate this view: neither

I question if his motion will find <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">a seconder</span></em>. You yourself

which you are without warrant of any kind, and which
you have no right to do. Westcott and Hort (the <span class="tei tei-q">“chartered

suggestion that these clauses are <span class="tei tei-q">“a quotation from <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">an early
Christian hymn</span></em>,”</span> they proceed to print the conclusion of
1 Tim. iii. 16 stichometrically, as if it were a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">six-line stanza</span></em>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This notwithstanding, the Revising body <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">have adopted</span></em> <span class="tei tei-q">“He

seems to me, and (I am glad to learn) to yourself also.
Their translation is quite a curiosity in its way. I proceed
to transcribe it:—

But this does not even pretend to be a sentence: nor do I

not this. The Latins,—calamitously shut up within the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page500">[pg 500]</span><a name="Pg500" id="Pg500" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
limits of their <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">pietatis sacramentum, quod</span></span>,”</span>—are found to
have habitually broken away from that iron bondage, and to
have discoursed of our <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Saviour Christ</span></span>, as being Himself the
<span class="tei tei-q">“sacramentum”</span> spoken of. The <span class="tei tei-q">“sacramentum,”</span> in their
view, was the incarnate <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Word</span></span>.<a id="noteref_1118" name="noteref_1118" href="#note_1118"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1118</span></span></a>—Not so the Greek Fathers.
These all, without exception, understood S. Paul to say,—what
Ecclesiastical Tradition hath all down the ages faithfully
attested, and what to this hour the copies of his Epistles
prove that he actually wrote,—viz. <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">And confessedly great is
the mystery of godliness</span></em>:—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">God</span></span> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">was manifested in the flesh,
justified in the spirit</span></em>,”</span> and so on. Moreover this is the view
of the matter in which all the learning and all the piety
of the English Church has thankfully acquiesced for the last
350 years. It has commended itself to Andrewes and
Pearson, Bull and Hammond, Hall and Stillingfleet, Ussher
and Beveridge, Mill and Bengel, Waterland and Berriman.
The enumeration of names is easily brought down to our
own times. Dr. Henderson, (the learned non-conformist

There remains, I believe, but one head of discourse into
which I have not yet followed you. I allude to your <span class="tei tei-q">“few

</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But (as you truly say) <span class="tei tei-q">“the number of living Scholars

of the Textual Criticism of the New Testament is exceedingly
small.”</span><a id="noteref_1122" name="noteref_1122" href="#note_1122"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1122</span></span></a> And, <span class="tei tei-q">“of that exceedingly small number,”</span>
you would be puzzled to name so much as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">one</span></em>, besides the
three you proceed to specify (viz. Dr. Scrivener, Dr. Westcott,
and Dr. Hort,)—who were members of the Revision company.
On the other hand,—(to quote the words of the most
learned of our living Prelates,)—<span class="tei tei-q">“it is well known that
there are <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">two opposite Schools</span></em> of Biblical Criticism among us,
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">with very different opinions as to the comparative value of our

Westcott and Hort</span></em>; <span class="tei tei-q">“and on the other”</span>—<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Dr. Scrivener</span></em>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Now, let the account be read which Dr. Newth gives (and
which you admit to be correct) of the extraordinary method
by which the <span class="tei tei-q">“New Greek Text”</span> was <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">settled</span></em>,”</span><a id="noteref_1124" name="noteref_1124" href="#note_1124"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1124</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-q">“for the

it was not by any means the product of the independently-formed
opinions of 16 experts, (as your words imply);
but resulted from the aptitude of 13 of your body to be
guided by the sober counsels of Dr. Scrivener on the one
hand, or to be carried away by the eager advocacy of
Dr. Hort, (supported as he ever was by his respected colleague
Dr. Westcott,) on the other. As Canon Cook well
puts it,—<span class="tei tei-q">“The question really is, Were the members competent
to form a correct judgment?”</span><a id="noteref_1126" name="noteref_1126" href="#note_1126"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1126</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-q">“In most cases,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">a

<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">ponderari debent testes</span></span>, my lord Bishop, <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">non numerari</span></span>.<a id="noteref_1128" name="noteref_1128" href="#note_1128"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1128</span></span></a> The
vote of the joint Editors should have been reckoned practically
as only <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">one</span></em> vote. And whenever Dr. Scrivener and
they were irreconcilably opposed, the existing Traditional
Text ought to have been let alone. All pretence that it was
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">plainly and clearly erroneous</span></em> was removed, when the only
experts present were hopelessly divided in opinion. As for
the rest of the Revising Body, inasmuch as they extemporized
their opinions, they were scarcely qualified to vote
at all. Certainly they were not entitled individually to an
equal voice with Dr. Scrivener in determining what the
text should be. Caprice or Prejudice, in short, it was, not
Deliberation and Learning, which prevailed in the Jerusalem
Chamber. A more unscientific,—to speak truly, a
coarser and a clumsier way of manipulating the sacred
Deposit, than that which you yourself invented, it would be
impossible, in my judgment, to devise.

But this is not nearly all. You invite attention to the
constituent elements of the Revising body, and congratulate
yourself on its miscellaneous character as providing a

</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I frankly avow, my lord Bishop, that the challenge you
thus deliberately offer, surprises me greatly. To have observed
severe silence on this part of the subject, would have seemed
to me your discreeter course. Moreover, had you not, in
this marked way, invited attention to the component elements
of the Revising body, I was prepared to give the subject
the go-by. The <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">New Greek Text</span></em>,”</span> no less than the <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">New

have no wish to prejudice the discussion by importing into it
foreign elements. Of this, you have had some proof already;
for, (with the exception of what is offered above, in pages
<a href="#Pg006" class="tei tei-ref">6</a> and <a href="#Pg007" class="tei tei-ref">7</a>,) the subject has been, by your present correspondent,
nowhere brought prominently forward.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Far be it from me, however, to decline the enquiry which
you evidently court. And so, I candidly avow that it was
in my account a serious breach of Church order that, on
engaging in so solemn an undertaking as the Revision of the
Authorized Version, a body of Divines professing to act
under the authority of the Southern Convocation should
spontaneously associate with themselves Ministers of various
denominations,<a id="noteref_1129" name="noteref_1129" href="#note_1129"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1129</span></span></a>—Baptists, Congregationalists, Wesleyan
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page505">[pg 505]</span><a name="Pg505" id="Pg505" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Methodists, Independents, and the like: and especially that
a successor of the Apostles should have presided over the
deliberations of this assemblage of Separatists. In my
humble judgment, we shall in vain teach the sinfulness of
Schism, if we show ourselves practically indifferent on the
subject, and even set an example of irregularity to our
flocks. My Divinity may appear unaccommodating and old-fashioned:
but I am not prepared to unlearn the lessons
long since got by heart in the school of Andrewes and
Hooker, of Pearson and Bull, of Hammond and Sanderson,
of Beveridge and Bramhall. I am much mistaken, moreover,
if I may not claim the authority of a greater doctor than
any of these,—I mean S. Paul,—for the fixed views I entertain
on this head.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
All this, however, is as nothing in comparison of the
scandal occasioned by the co-optation into your body of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page506">[pg 506]</span><a name="Pg506" id="Pg506" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Dr. G. Vance Smith, the Unitarian Minister of S. Saviour's
Gate Chapel, York. That, while engaged in the work of
interpreting the everlasting Gospel, you should have knowingly
and by choice associated with yourselves one who, not
only openly denies the eternal Godhead of our <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span></span>, but in
a recent publication is the avowed assailant of that fundamental
doctrine of the Christian Religion, as well as of the
Inspiration of Holy Scripture itself,<a id="noteref_1130" name="noteref_1130" href="#note_1130"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1130</span></span></a>—filled me (and many
besides myself) with astonishment and sorrow. You were
respectfully memorialized on the subject;<a id="noteref_1131" name="noteref_1131" href="#note_1131"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1131</span></span></a> but you treated
the representations which reached you with scornful indifference.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Now therefore that you re-open the question, I will not
scruple publicly to repeat that it seems to me nothing else
but an insult to our Divine Master and a wrong to the
Church, that the most precious part of our common Christian
heritage, the pure Word of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">God</span></span>, should day by day, week
by week, month by month, year after year, have been thus
handled; for the avowed purpose of producing a Translation
which should supersede our Authorized Version. That
the individual in question contributed aught to your deliberations
has never been pretended. On the contrary. No
secret has been made of the fact that he was, (as might have
been anticipated from his published writings,) the most
unprofitable member of the Revising body. Why then was
he at first surreptitiously elected? and why was his election
afterwards stiffly maintained? The one purpose achieved by
his continued presence among you was that it might be
thereby made to appear that the Church of England no
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page507">[pg 507]</span><a name="Pg507" id="Pg507" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
longer insists on Belief in the eternal Godhead of our <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span></span>,
as essential; but is prepared to surrender her claim to
definite and unequivocal dogmatic teaching in respect of
Faith in the Blessed <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Trinity</span></span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But even if this Unitarian had been an eminent Scholar,
my objection would remain in full force; for I hold, (and
surely so do you!), that the right Interpretation of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">God's</span></span>
Word may not be attained without the guidance of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Holy
Spirit</span></span>, whose aid must first be invoked by faithful prayer.

In the meantime, this same person was invited to communicate
with his fellow-Revisers in Westminster-Abbey,

Dean Stanley: declaring, next day, that he received the

(3) <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The probable Future of the Revision of</span></span> 1881.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Not unaware am I that it has nevertheless been once
and again confidently predicted in public Addresses, Lectures,
Pamphlets, that ultimate success is in store for the
Revision of 1881. I cannot but regard it as a suspicious
circumstance that these vaticinations have hitherto invariably
proceeded from members of the Revising body.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It would ill become such an one as myself to pretend to
skill in forecasting the future. But of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">this</span></em> at least I feel
certain:—that if, in an evil hour, (quod absit!), the Church
of England shall ever be induced to commit herself to the
adoption of the present Revision, she will by so doing expose
herself to the ridicule of the rest of Christendom, as well as
incur irreparable harm and loss. And such a proceeding
on her part will be inexcusable, for she has been at least
faithfully forewarned. Moreover, in the end, she will most
certainly have to retrace her steps with sorrow and confusion.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Those persons evidently overlook the facts of the problem,
who refer to what happened in the case of the Authorized
Version when it originally appeared, some 270 years ago;
and argue that as the Revision of 1611 at first encountered
opposition, which yet it ultimately overcame, so must it fare
in the end with the present Revised Version also. Those
who so reason forget that the cases are essentially dissimilar.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page509">[pg 509]</span><a name="Pg509" id="Pg509" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
If the difference between the Authorized Version of 1611
and the Revision of 1881 were only this.—That the latter is
characterized by a mechanical, unidiomatic, and even repulsive
method of rendering; which was not only unattempted,
but repudiated by the Authors of the earlier work;—there
would have been something to urge on behalf of the later
performance. The plea of zeal for <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">God's</span></span> Word,—a determination
at all hazards to represent with even servile precision
the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">ipsissima verba</span></span> of Evangelists and Apostles,—<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">this</span></em>
plea might have been plausibly put forward: and, to
some extent, it must have been allowed,—although a grave
diversity of opinion might reasonably have been entertained
as to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">what constitutes</span></em> <span class="tei tei-q">“accuracy”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“fidelity”</span> of translation.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But when once it has been made plain that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the underlying
Greek</span></em> of the Revision of 1881 is an entirely new thing,—<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">is a
manufactured article throughout</span></em>,—all must see that the contention
has entirely changed its character. The question
immediately arises, (and it is the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">only</span></em> question which
remains to be asked,)—Were then the Authors of this <span class="tei tei-q">“New
Greek Text”</span> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">competent</span></em> to undertake so perilous an enterprise?
And when, in the words of the distinguished Chairman
of the Revising body—(words quoted above, at page
<a href="#Pg369" class="tei tei-ref">369</a>,)—<span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">To this question, we venture to answer very unhesitatingly
in the negative</span></em>,”</span>—What remains but, with blank
astonishment, not unmingled with disgust, to close the
volume? Your own ingenuous admission,—(volunteered by
yourself a few days before you and your allies <span class="tei tei-q">“proceeded
to the actual details of the Revision,”</span>)—that <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">we have
certainly not acquired sufficient Critical Judgment</span></em> for any body
of Revisers hopefully to undertake such a work as this,”</span>—is
decisive on the subject.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The gravity of the issue thus raised, it is impossible to
over-estimate. We find ourselves at once and entirely
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page510">[pg 510]</span><a name="Pg510" id="Pg510" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
lifted out of the region originally proposed for investigation.
It is no longer a question of the degree of skill which
has been exhibited in translating the title-deeds of our
heavenly inheritance out of Greek into English. Those
title-deeds themselves have been empirically submitted to a
process which, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">rightly or wrongly</span></em>, seriously affects their integrity.
Not only has a fringe of most unreasonable textual
mistrust been tacked on to the margin of every inspired
page, (as from S. Luke x. 41 to xi. 11):—not only has many
a grand doctrinal statement been evacuated of its authority,
(as, by the shameful mis-statement found in the margin
against S. John iii. 13,<a id="noteref_1135" name="noteref_1135" href="#note_1135"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1135</span></span></a> and the vile Socinian gloss which
disfigures the margin of Rom. ix. 5<a id="noteref_1136" name="noteref_1136" href="#note_1136"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1136</span></span></a>):—but we entirely miss
many a solemn utterance of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Spirit</span></span>,—as when we are
assured that verses 44 and 46 of S. Mark ix. are omitted by
<span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the best ancient authorities</span></em>,”</span> (whereas, on the contrary, the
MSS. referred to are <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the worst</span></em>). Let the thing complained of
be illustrated by a few actual examples. Only five shall be
subjoined. The words in the first column represent what
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">you</span></em> are pleased to designate as among <span class="tei tei-q">“the most certain
conclusions of modern Textual Criticism”</span> (p. 78),—but what
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">I</span></em> assert to be nothing else but mutilated exhibitions of the
inspired Text. The second column contains the indubitable
Truth of Scripture,—the words which have been read by our
Fathers' Fathers for the last 500 years, and which we
propose, (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">God</span></span> helping us,) to hand on unimpaired to our
Children, and to our Children's Children, for many a century
to come:—

I am saying that the systematic, and sometimes serious,—<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">always</span></em>
inexcusable,—liberties which have been taken with
the Greek Text by the Revisionists of 1881, constitute a
ground of offence against their work for which no pretext
was afforded by the Revision of 1611. To argue therefore
from what has been the fate of the one, to what is likely to
be the fate of the other, is illogical. The cases are not only
not parallel: they are even wholly dissimilar.

The cheapest copies of our Authorized Version at least
exhibit the Word of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">God</span></span> faithfully and helpfully. Could
the same be said of a cheap edition of the work of the
Revisionists,—destitute of headings to the Chapters, and
containing no record of the extent to which the Sacred Text
has undergone depravation throughout?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Let it be further recollected that the greatest Scholars and
the most learned Divines of which our Church could boast,
conducted the work of Revision in King James' days; and
it will be acknowledged that the promiscuous assemblage
which met in the Jerusalem Chamber cannot urge any
corresponding claim on public attention. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Then</span></em>, the Bishops
of Lincoln of 1611 were Revisers: the Vance Smiths stood
without and found fault. But in the affair of 1881,
Dr. Vance Smith revises, and ventilates heresy from within:<a id="noteref_1142" name="noteref_1142" href="#note_1142"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1142</span></span></a>
the Bp. of Lincoln stands outside, and is one of the severest
Critics of the work.—Disappointed men are said to have been
conspicuous among the few assailants of our <span class="tei tei-q">“Authorized
Version,”</span>—Scholars (as Hugh Broughton) who considered
themselves unjustly overlooked and excluded. But on the
present occasion, among the multitude of hostile voices,
there is not a single instance known of a man excluded from
the deliberations of the Jerusalem Chamber, who desired to
share them.

To argue therefore concerning the prospects of the Revision
of 1881 from the known history of our Authorized Version
of 1611, is to argue concerning things essentially dissimilar.
With every advance made in the knowledge of the subject,

increased distrust of the Revision of 1881, and an ever
increasing aversion from it.

Here I lay down my pen,—glad to have completed what
(because I have endeavoured to do my work <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">thoroughly</span></em>) has
proved a very laborious task indeed. The present rejoinder
to your Pamphlet covers all the ground you have yourself
traversed, and will be found to have disposed of your entire
contention.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I take leave to point out, in conclusion, that it places you
individually in a somewhat embarrassing predicament. For
you have now no alternative but to come forward and
disprove my statements as well as refute my arguments: or
to admit, by your silence, that you have sustained defeat in
the cause of which you constituted yourself the champion.
You constrained me to reduce you to this alternative when
you stood forth on behalf of the Revising body, and saw fit
to provoke me to a personal encounter.

But you must come provided with something vastly more
formidable, remember, than denunciations,—which are but
wind: and vague generalities,—which prove nothing and
persuade nobody: and appeals to the authority of <span class="tei tei-q">“Lachmann,

disregard. You must produce a counter-array of well-ascertained
facts; and you must build thereupon irrefragable
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page515">[pg 515]</span><a name="Pg515" id="Pg515" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
arguments. In other words, you must conduct your cause
with learning and ability. Else, believe me, you will make
the painful discovery that <span class="tei tei-q">“the last error is worse than the
first.”</span> You had better a thousand times, even now, ingenuously
admit that you made a grievous mistake when you put yourself
into the hands of those ingenious theorists, Drs. Westcott

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And yet, it was no isolated place which I was eager to establish,
when at first I took up my pen. It was the general trustworthiness
of the Traditional Text,—(the Text which you admit
to be upwards of 1500 years old,)—which I aimed at illustrating:
the essential rottenness of the foundation on which
the Greek Text of the Revision of 1881 has been constructed by
yourself and your fellow Revisers,—which I was determined to
expose. I claim to have proved not only that your entire
superstructure is tasteless and unlovely to a degree,—but
also that you have reared it up on a foundation of sand. In
no vaunting spirit, (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">God</span></span> is my witness!), but out of sincere
and sober zeal for the truth of Scripture I say it,—your
work, whether you know it or not, has been so handled in
the course of the present volume of 500 pages that its
essential deformity must be apparent to every unprejudiced
beholder. It can only be spoken of at this time of day as a
shapeless ruin.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A ruin moreover it is which does not admit of being
repaired or restored. And why? Because the mischief,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page517">[pg 517]</span><a name="Pg517" id="Pg517" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

And further, (to speak without a figure,) it cannot be too
plainly stated that no compromise is possible between our
respective methods,—yours and mine: between the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">new

form, to which you have incautiously and unconditionally
given in your adhesion; and the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">old English</span></span> school of
Textual Criticism, of which I humbly avow myself a disciple.
Between the theory of Drs. Westcott and Hort (which you
have made your own) and the method of your present
Correspondent, there can be no compromise, because
the two are antagonistic throughout. We have, in fact,
nothing in common,—except certain documents; which <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">I</span></em>
insist on interpreting by the humble Inductive process:
while you and your friends insist on your right of deducing
your estimate of them from certain antecedent imaginations
of your own,—every one of which I disallow, and some of
which I am able to disprove.

diametrically opposed throughout. Finally,—(8) <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">You</span></em> assume
that you possess a power of divination which enables you
to dispense with laborious processes of Induction; while I,
on the contrary, insist that the Truth of the Text of Scripture
is to be elicited exclusively from the consentient testimony
of the largest number of the best <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Copies</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Fathers</span></span>,

attainment of Truth in this department of Knowledge. Only
through the lowly portal of humility,—only by self-renouncing
labour,—may we ever hope to reach the innermost shrine.
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">They</span></em> do but go astray themselves and hopelessly mislead
others, who first <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">invent their facts</span></em>, and then proceed to
build thereupon their premisses.

I repeat, (for I wish it to be distinctly understood and
remembered,) that what I assert concerning those Critics
is,—<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">not</span></em> that their superstructure rests upon an insecure

between <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">their</span></em> mere assumptions and the results of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">my</span></em>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Let me be allowed, in conclusion, to recommend to your
attention and that of your friends,—(I.) <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">The last Twelve
Verses of S. Mark's Gospel</span></span>:”</span>—(II.) <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">the Angelic
Hymn</span></span> on the night of the Nativity:—(III.) The text of
1 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Timothy</span></span> iii. 16,—these three,—(in respect of which up to
this hour, you and I find ourselves to be hopelessly divided,)—as
convenient <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Test places</span></em>. When you are prepared frankly
to admit,—(I.) That there is no reason whatever for doubting
the genuineness of S. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Mark</span></span> xvi. 9-20:<a id="noteref_1151" name="noteref_1151" href="#note_1151"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1151</span></span></a>—(II.) That ἐν

what the great Apostle must be held to have written in

something else. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Until</span></em> this happy result has been attained, it
is a mere waste of time to break up fresh ground, and to
extend the area of our differences.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I cannot however disguise from you the fact that such an
avowal on your part will amount to an admission that <span class="tei tei-q">“the
whole fabric of Textual Criticism which has been built up
during the last fifty years by successive editors of the New
Testament,”</span>—Lachmann namely, Tischendorf, and Tregelles,—is
worthless. Neither may the inevitable consequence
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page520">[pg 520]</span><a name="Pg520" id="Pg520" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of this admission be concealed: viz. that your own work as
Revisionists has been, to speak plainly, one gigantic blunder,
from end to end.

(8) <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The subject dismissed.</span></span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The issue of this prolonged contention I now commend,
with deep humility, to <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Almighty God</span></span>. The <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Spirit of Truth</span></span>
will, (I know,) take good care of His own masterpiece,—the
Written Word. May He have compassion on my ignorance,
and graciously forgive me, if, (intending nothing less,) I shall
prove to have anywhere erred in my strenuous endeavour to
maintain the integrity of Scripture against the rashness of an
impatient and unlearned generation.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But if, (as I humbly believe and confidently hope,) my
conclusions are sound throughout, then may He enable men
freely to recognize the Truth; and thus, effectually avert from
our Church the supreme calamity with which, for a few
months in 1881, it seemed threatened; namely, of having an
utterly depraved Recension of the Greek Text of the New
Testament thrust upon it, as the basis of a very questionable
'Revision' of the English.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The inquiries into which I was led (January to June 1883)
by my <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Dissertation</span></span> in vindication of the Traditional Reading
of 1 Tim. iii. 16, have resulted in my being made aware of the
existence of a vast number of Sacred Codices which had eluded
the vigilance of previous Critics.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I had already assisted my friend Prebendary Scrivener
in greatly enlarging Scholz's list. We had in fact raised the
enumeration of <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Evangelia</span></span>”</span> to 621: of <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Acts and Catholic

a total of 1629.—But at the end of a protracted and
somewhat laborious correspondence with the custodians of not
a few great Continental Libraries, I am able to state that our
available <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Evangelia</span></span>”</span> amount to at least 739<a id="noteref_1154" name="noteref_1154" href="#note_1154"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1154</span></span></a>: our <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Acts and

a total of 2003. This shows an increase of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">three hundred and
seventy-four</span></em>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
My original intention had been to publish this enumeration
of Sacred Codices in its entirety as an <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Appendix</span></span> to the present
volume: but finding that the third edition of Dr. Scrivener's
<span class="tei tei-q">“Introduction”</span> would appear some months before my own
pages could possibly see the light, I eagerly communicated my
discoveries to my friend. I have indeed proposed to myself no
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page522">[pg 522]</span><a name="Pg522" id="Pg522" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
other object throughout but the advancement of the study
of Textual Criticism: and it was reasonable to hope that by
means of his widely circulated volume, the great enlargement
which our previously ascertained stores have suddenly experienced
would become more generally known to scholars. I
should of course still have it in my power to reproduce here the
same enumeration of Sacred Codices.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The great bulk however which the present volume has
acquired, induces me to limit myself in this place to some
account of those Codices which have been expressly announced
and discoursed about in my Text (as at pp. <a href="#Pg474" class="tei tei-ref">474</a> and <a href="#Pg492" class="tei tei-ref">492-5</a>).
Some other occasion must be found for enlarging on the rest of
my budget.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It only remains to state that for most of my recent discoveries
I am indebted to the Abbate Cozza-Luzi, Prefect of the Vatican;
who on being informed of the object of my solicitude, with
extraordinary liberality and consideration at once set three
competent young men to work in the principal libraries of
Rome. To him I am further indebted for my introduction to
the MS. treasures belonging to the Basilian monks of Crypta-Ferrata,
the ancient Tusculum. Concerning the precious
library of that monastery so much has been offered already
(viz. at pp. <a href="#Pg446" class="tei tei-ref">446-448</a>, and again at pp. <a href="#Pg473" class="tei tei-ref">473-4</a>), as well as
concerning its learned chief, the Hieromonachus Antonio
Rocchi, that I must be content to refer my readers to those
earlier parts of the present volume. I cannot however sufficiently
acknowledge the patient help which the librarian of
Crypta Ferrata has rendered me in the course of these researches.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
For my knowledge of the sacred Codices preserved at Messina,
I am indebted to the good offices and learning of Papas Filippo
Matranga. In respect of those at Milan, my learned friend
Dr. Ceriani has (not for the first time) been my efficient helper.
M. Wescher has kindly assisted me at Paris; and Dr. C. de
Boor at Berlin. It must suffice, for the rest, to refer to the
Notes at foot of pp. <a href="#Pg491" class="tei tei-ref">491-2</a> and <a href="#Pg477" class="tei tei-ref">477-8</a>.

of 254, as stated in p. <a href="#Pg495" class="tei tei-ref">495</a> (line 21 from the bottom)],—are found
to witness to the Reading here contended for. The enumeration
of Codices at page <a href="#Pg494" class="tei tei-ref">494</a> is therefore to be continued as
follows:—310, 311, 319, 327, 328, 336, 337, 338.

for March 1882: from which it chiefly appears that Canon (now Archdeacon)
Farrar is unable to forgive S. Mark the Evangelist for having
written the 16th verse of his concluding chapter. The Venerable writer
is in consequence for ever denouncing those <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">last Twelve Verses</span></span>.”</span> In
March 1882, (pretending to review my Articles in the <span class="tei tei-q">“Quarterly,”</span>) he
says:—<span class="tei tei-q">“In spite of Dean Burgon's Essay on the subject, the minds of
most scholars are <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">quite unalterably made up</span></em> on such questions as the
authenticity of the last twelve verses of S. Mark.”</span> [<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Contemporary Review</span></span>,
vol. xli. p. 365.] And in the ensuing October,—<span class="tei tei-q">“If, among <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">positive
results</span></em>, any one should set down such facts as that ... Mark xvi. 9-20 ...
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">formed no part of the original apostolic autograph</span></em> ... He, I say, who
should enumerate these points as being <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">beyond the reach of serious dispute</span></em> ...
would be expressing the views which are <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">regarded as indisputable</span></em> by
the vast majority of such recent critics as have established any claim to
serious attention.”</span> [<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Expositor</span></span>, p. 173.]

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It may not be without use to the Venerable writer that he should be
reminded that critical questions, instead of being disposed of by such language
as the foregoing, are not even touched thereby. One is surprised to
have to tell a <span class="tei tei-q">“fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge,”</span> so obvious a truth
as that by such writing he does but effectually put himself out of court.
By proclaiming that his mind is <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">quite unalterably made up</span></em>”</span> that the
end of S. Mark's Gospel is not authentic, he admits that he is impervious
to argument and therefore incapable of understanding proof. It is a mere
waste of time to reason with an unfortunate who announces that he
is beyond the reach of conviction.</p></dd><dt class="tei tei-notelabel"><a id="note_10" name="note_10" href="#noteref_10">10.</a></dt><dd class="tei tei-notetext">No. xxviii., page 436. If any one cares to know what the teaching

Article in the present volume will be found to supply an ample exposure
of the shallowness of Drs. Westcott and Hort's Textual Theory.</span></span>]
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
While these sheets are passing through the press, a copy of the long-expected
volume reaches us. The theory of the respected authors proves
to be the shallowest imaginable. It is briefly <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">this</span></em>:—Fastening on the two
oldest codices extant (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b</span></span> and א, both of the IVth century), they invent the
following hypothesis:—<span class="tei tei-q">“That the ancestries of those two manuscripts
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">diverged from a point near the autographs, and never came into contact
subsequently</span></em>.”</span> [No reason is produced for this opinion.]
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Having thus secured two independent witnesses of what was in the
sacred autographs, the Editors claim that the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">coincidence</span></em> of א and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b</span></span> must
<span class="tei tei-q">“mark those portions of text in which two primitive and entirely separate
lines of transmission had not come to differ from each other through
independent corruption:”</span> and therefore that, <span class="tei tei-q">“in the absence of specially
strong internal evidence to the contrary,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“the readings of א and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b</span></span> combined
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">may safely be accepted as genuine</span></em>.”</span>
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But what is to be done when the same two codices diverge <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">one from the
other</span></em>?—In all such cases (we are assured) the readings of any <span class="tei tei-q">“binary
combination”</span> of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b</span></span> are to be preferred; because <span class="tei tei-q">“on the closest scrutiny,”</span>
they generally <span class="tei tei-q">“have the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ring of genuineness</span></em>;”</span> hardly ever <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">look suspicious</span></em>
after full consideration.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Even when <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b</span></span> stands quite alone, its
readings must never be lightly rejected.”</span> [We are not told why.]
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But, (rejoins the student who, after careful collation of codex <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b</span></span>, has
arrived at a vastly different estimate of its character,)—What is to be
done when internal and external evidence alike condemn a reading of B?
How is <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">mumpsimus</span></span>”</span> for example to be treated?—<span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Mumpsimus</span></span>”</span> (the
Editors solemnly reply) as <span class="tei tei-q">“the better attested reading”</span>—(by which they
mean the reading attested by <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b</span></span>,)—we place in our margin. <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sumpsimus</span></span>,”</span>
apparently the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">right</span></em> reading, we place in the text within ††; in token that
it is probably <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">a successful ancient conjecture</span></em>.”</span>
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We smile, and resume:—But how is the fact to be accounted for that
the text of Chrysostom and (in the main) of the rest of the IVth-century
Fathers, to whom we are so largely indebted for our critical materials, and
who must have employed codices fully as old as <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b</span></span> and א: how is it, we
ask, that the text of all these, including codex <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a</span></span>, differs essentially from
the text exhibited by codices <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b</span></span> and א?—The editors reply,—The text of
Chrysostom and the rest, we designate <span class="tei tei-q">“Syrian,”</span> and assume to have been
the result of an <span class="tei tei-q">“editorial Revision,”</span> which we conjecturally assign to the
second half of the IIIrd century. It is the <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Pre-Syrian</span></em>”</span> text that we are
in search of; and we recognize the object of our search in codex <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b</span></span>.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We stare, and smile again. But how then does it come to pass (we
rejoin) that the Peschito, or primitive <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Syriac</span></em>, which is older by full a
century and a half than the last-named date, is practically still the same
text?—This fatal circumstance (not overlooked by the learned Editors)
they encounter with another conjectural assumption. <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">A Revision</span></span>”</span> (say
they) <span class="tei tei-q">“of the Old Syriac version appears to have taken place early in the
IVth century, or sooner; and doubtless in some connexion with the
Syrian revision of the Greek text, the readings being to a very great
extent coincident.”</span>
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And pray, where <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">is</span></em> <span class="tei tei-q">“the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Old Syriac</span></em> version”</span> of which you speak?—It
is (reply the Editors) our way of designating the fragmentary Syriac MS.
commonly known as <span class="tei tei-q">“Cureton's.”</span>—Your way (we rejoin) of manipulating
facts, and disposing of evidence is certainly the most convenient, as it is
the most extraordinary, imaginable: yet is it altogether inadmissible in a
grave enquiry like the present. Syriac scholars are of a widely different
opinion from yourselves. Do you not perceive that you have been drawing
upon your imagination for every one of your facts?
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We decline in short on the mere conjectural <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">ipse dixit</span></span> of these two
respected scholars to admit either that the Peschito is a Revision of
Cureton's Syriac Version;—or that it was executed about <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 325;—or
that the text of Chrysostom and the other principal IVth-century Fathers
is the result of an unrecorded <span class="tei tei-q">“Antiochian Revision”</span> which took place
about the year <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 275.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
[But instead of troubling ourselves with removing the upper story of
the visionary structure before us,—which reminds us painfully of a house
which we once remember building with playing-cards,—we begin by
removing the basement-story, which brings the entire superstructure in
an instant to the ground.]
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
For we decline to admit that the texts exhibited by <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b</span></span> א can have
<span class="tei tei-q">“diverged from a point near the sacred autographs, and never come into
contact subsequently.”</span> We are able to show, on the contrary, that the
readings they jointly embody afford the strongest presumption that the
MSS. which contain them are nothing else but specimens of those <span class="tei tei-q">“corrected,”</span>
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">corrupted</span></em> copies, which are known to have abounded in the
earliest ages of the Church. From the prevalence of identical depravations
in either, we infer that they are, on the contrary, derived from the same
not very remote depraved original: and therefore, that their coincidence,
when they differ from all (or nearly all) other MSS., so far from marking
<span class="tei tei-q">“two primitive and entirely separate lines of transmission”</span> of the inspired
autographs, does but mark what was derived from the same corrupt
common ancestor; whereby the supposed two independent witnesses to the
Evangelic verity become resolved into <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">a single witness to a fabricated text
of the IIIrd century</span></em>.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is impossible in the meantime to withhold from these learned and
excellent men (who are infinitely better than their theory) the tribute of
our sympathy and concern at the evident perplexity and constant distress
to which their own fatal major premiss has reduced them. The Nemesis
of Superstition and Idolatry is ever the same. Doubt,—unbelief,—credulity,—general
mistrust of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">all</span></em> evidence, is the inevitable sequel and
penalty. In 1870, Drs. Westcott and Hort solemnly assured their brother
Revisionists that <span class="tei tei-q">“the prevalent assumption, that throughout the N. T. the
true text is to be found <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">somewhere</span></em> among recorded readings, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">does not stand
the test of experience</span></em>;”</span>[P. xxi.] and they are evidently still haunted by the same
spectral suspicion. They see a ghost to be exorcised in every dark corner.
<span class="tei tei-q">“The Art of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Conjectural Emendation</span></em>”</span> (says Dr. Hort) <span class="tei tei-q">“depends for its
success so much on personal endowments, fertility of resource in the first
instance, and even more an appreciation of language too delicate to acquiesce
in merely plausible corrections, that it is easy to forget its true character
as a critical operation founded on knowledge and method.”</span>[<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Introd.</span></span> p. 71.] Specimens of
the writer's skill in this department abound. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">One</span></em> occurs at p. 135 (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">App.</span></span>)
where, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in defiance of every known document</span></em>, he seeks to evacuate S. Paul's
memorable injunction to Timothy (2 Tim. i. 13) of all its significance.

It were unhandsome, however, to take leave of the learned labours of
Prebendary Scrivener and Archdeacon Palmer, without a few words of
sympathy and admiration. Their volumes (mentioned at the beginning
of the present Article) are all that was to have been expected from the
exquisite scholarship of their respective editors, and will be of abiding
interest and value. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Both</span></em> volumes should be in the hands of every
scholar, for neither of them supersedes the other. Dr. Scrivener has (with

the Greek Text which was followed by the Revisers of 1611</span></em>, viz. Beza's

the Text by the Revisers of 1881.—Dr. Palmer, taking the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Text of Stephens</span></span>
(1550) as his basis, presents us with the Readings adopted by the Revisers
of the <span class="tei tei-q">“Authorized Version,”</span> and relegates the displaced Readings (of 1611)
to the foot of each page.—We cordially congratulate them both, and thank

Different must have been the reading of that other venerable exemplar
which supplied the Latin Church with its earliest Text. But of this let
the reader judge:—<span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Et cum audisset illum multa facere, libenter</span></span>,”</span> &amp;c. (c:

wrought, and he gladly heard him</span></em>”</span>) approaches nearest to the last two.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Peschito Syriac (which is without variety of reading here) in strictness
exhibits:—<span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">And many things he was hearing [from] him and doing;

is considered to represent,—καὶ πολλὰ ἀκούων αὐτοῦ, ἐποίει; καὶ ἡδέως
ἤκουεν αὐτοῦ.—Cod. Δ is peculiar in exhibiting καὶ ἀκούσας αὐτοῦ πολλά,
ἡδέως αὐτοῦ ἤκουεν,—omitting ἐποίει, καί.—The Coptic also renders, <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">et
audiebat multa ab eo, et anxio erat corde</span></span>.”</span> From all this, it becomes clear
that the actual <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">intention</span></em> of the blundering author of the text exhibited by
א <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b l</span></span> was, to connect πολλά, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">not</span></em> with ἠπόρει, but with ἀκούσας. So the

Dr. S. C. Malan informs the Reviewer.</p></dd><dt class="tei tei-notelabel"><a id="note_174" name="note_174" href="#noteref_174">174.</a></dt><dd class="tei tei-notetext">Note, that tokens abound of a determination anciently to assimilate
the Gospels hereabouts. Thus, because the first half of Luke ix. 10 (ϟα / η)
and the whole of Mk. vi. 30 (ξα / η)
are bracketed together by Eusebius, the
former place in codex <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a</span></span> is found brought into conformity with the latter
by the unauthorized insertion of the clause καὶ ὅσα ἐδίδαξαν.—The
parallelism of Mtt. xiv. 13 and Lu. ix. 10 is the reason why <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">d</span></span> exhibits in
the latter place ἀν- (instead of ὑπ)εχώρησε.—In like manner, in Lu. ix.
10, codex <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a</span></span> exhibits εἰς ἔρημον τόπον, instead of εἰς τόπον ἔρημον; only
because ἔρημον τόπον is the order of Mtt. xiv. 13 and Mk. vi. 32.—So
again, codex א, in the same verse of S. Luke, entirely omits the final clause
πόλεως καλουμένης Βηθσαῖδά, only in order to assimilate its text to that of
the two earlier Gospels.—But there is no need to look beyond the limits of
S. Mark vi. 14-16, for proofs of Assimilation. Instead of ἐκ νεκρῶν ἠγέρθη
(in ver. 14), <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b</span></span> and א exhibit ἐγήγερται ἐκ νεκρῶν—only because those words
are found in Lu. ix. 7. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a</span></span> substitutes ἀνέστη (for ἠγέρθη)—only because that
word is found in Lu. ix. 8. For ἠγέρθη ἐκ νεκρῶν, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">c</span></span> substitutes ἠγέρθη ἀπὸ
τῶν νεκρῶν—only because S. Matth. so writes in ch. xiv. 2. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">d</span></span> inserts καὶ
ἔβαλεν εἰς φυλακήν into ver. 17—only because of Mtt. xiv. 3 and Lu. iii.
20. In א <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b l</span></span> Δ, βαπτίζοντος (for βαπτιστοῦ) stands in ver. 24—only by
Assimilation with ver. 14. (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">l</span></span> is for assimilating ver. 25 likewise), Κ Δ Π,
the Syr., and copies of the old Latin, transpose ἐνεργοῦσιν αἱ δυνάμεις (in
ver. 14)—only because those words are transposed in Mtt. xiv. 2.... If
facts like these do not open men's eyes to the danger of following the
fashionable guides, it is to be feared that nothing ever will. The foulest
blot of all remains to be noticed. Will it be believed that in ver. 22,
codices א <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b d l</span></span> Δ conspire in representing the dancer (whose name is
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">known</span></em> to have been <span class="tei tei-q">“Salome”</span>) as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">another </span><span class="tei tei-q">“Herodias”</span></em>—<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Herod's own

hitherto by <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">all</span></em> the editors and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">all</span></em> the critics—finds undoubting favour

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Father</span></span> to his own approximate locality: then let him bear in mind that
995 out of 1000 of the extant <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Manuscripts</span></span> agree with those Fathers and
Versions; and let him further recognize that those MSS. (executed at

</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Drs. Westcott and Hort inform us that <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the character of the attestation</span></em>
marks”</span> the clause (ὁ ὢν ἐν τῷ οὐρανῷ), <span class="tei tei-q">“as a <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Western gloss</span></span>.”</span> But the
<span class="tei tei-q">“attestation”</span> for retaining that clause—(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">a</span></span>) Comes demonstrably from
every quarter of ancient Christendom:—(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">b</span></span>) Is more ancient (by 200 years)
than the evidence for omitting it:—(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">c</span></span>) Is more numerous, in the proportion
of 99 to 1:—(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">d</span></span>) In point of respectability, stands absolutely alone.
For since we have <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">proved</span></em> that Origen and Didymus, Epiphanius and Cyril,
Ambrose and Jerome, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">recognize</span></em> the words in dispute, of what possible
Textual significancy can it be if presently (<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">because it is sufficient for their
purpose</span></em>) the same Fathers are observed to quote S. John iii. 13 <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">no further
than down to the words </span><span class="tei tei-q">“Son of Man”</span></em>? No person, (least of all a professed
Critic,) who adds to his learning a few grains of common sense and a
little candour, can be misled by such a circumstance. Origen, Eusebius,
Proclus, Ephraim Syrus, Jerome, Marius, when they are only insisting
on the doctrinal significancy of the earlier words, naturally end their
quotation at this place. The two Gregories (Naz. [ii. 87, 168]: Nyss.
[Galland. vi. 522]), writing against the Apolinarian heresy, of course
quoted the verse no further than Apolinaris himself was accustomed (for
his heresy) to adduce it.... About the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">internal</span></em> evidence for the clause,
nothing has been said; but <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">this</span></em> is simply overwhelming. We make our

by Sir Edmund Beckett, entitled, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Should the Revised New Testament be
Authorized?</span></span> In four Chapters, the author discusses with characteristic
vigour, first, the principles and method of the Revisers, and then the
Gospel of S. Matthew, the Epistle to the Hebrews, and the Apocalypse, as
fair samples of their work, with a union of sound sense, forensic skill, and
scholarship more skilful than to deserve his cautious disclaimer. Amidst
details open, of course, to discussion, abundant proofs are set forth, in a
most telling style, that the plea of <span class="tei tei-q">“necessity”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“faithfulness”</span> utterly
fails, in justification of a mass of alterations, which, in point of English
composition, carry their condemnation on their face, and, to sum up the
great distinction between the two Versions, illustrate <span class="tei tei-q">“the difference between
working by <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">discretion</span></em> and by <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">rules</span></em>—by which no great thing was ever
done or ever will be.”</span> Sir Edmund Beckett is very happy in his exposure
of the abuse of the famous canon of preferring the stranger reading to the
more obvious, as if copyists never made stupid blunders or perpetrated
wilful absurdities. The work deserves the notice of all English readers.</dd><dt class="tei tei-notelabel"><a id="note_698" name="note_698" href="#noteref_698">698.</a></dt><dd class="tei tei-notetext"><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It has been objected by certain of the Revisionists that it is not fair to

That <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">some</span></em> corrections of the Text were necessary, we are well aware: and
had those <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">necessary</span></em> changes been made, we should only have had words of
commendation and thanks to offer. But it is found that by Dr. Hort's
eager advocacy two-thirds of the Revisionists have made a vast number
of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">perfectly needless changes</span></em>:—(1) Changes which <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">are incapable of being
represented in a Translation</span></em>: as ἐμοῦ for μου,—πάντες for ἅπαντες,—ὅτε
for ὁπότε. Again, since γέννησις, at least as much as γένεσις, means
<span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">birth</span></em>,”</span> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">why</span></em> γένεσις in S. Matth. i. 18? Why, also, inform us that instead
of ἐν τῷ ἀμπελῶνι αὐτοῦ πεφυτευμένην, they prefer πεφυτευμένην ἐν τῷ
ἀμπελῶνι αὐτοῦ? and instead of καρπὸν ζητῶν,—ζητῶν καρπόν? Now this
they have done <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">throughout</span></em>,—at least 341 times in S. Luke alone. But
(what is far worse), (2) They suggest in the margin changes which yet
they <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">do not adopt</span></em>. These numerous changes are, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">by their own confession</span></em>,
not <span class="tei tei-q">“necessary:”</span> and yet they are of a most serious character. In fact, it
is of these we chiefly complain.—But, indeed (3), <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">How many</span></em> of their <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">other</span></em>
alterations of the Text will the Revisionists undertake to defend publicly

found enumerated Dr. Scrivener's principal works. It shall but be said of
them, that they are wholly unrivalled, or rather unapproached, in their
particular department. Himself an exact and elegant Scholar,—a most
patient and accurate observer of Textual phenomena, as well as an
interesting and judicious expositor of their significance and value;—guarded
in his statements, temperate in his language, fair and impartial
(even kind) to all who come in his way:—Dr. Scrivener is the very best
teacher and guide to whom a beginner can resort, who desires to be led by
the hand, as it were, through the intricate mazes of Textual Criticism.
His <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Plain Introduction to the Criticism of the New Testament for the use of
Biblical Students</span></span>, (of which a third edition is now in the press,) is perforce
the most generally useful, because the most comprehensive, of his works;
but we strenuously recommend the three prefatory chapters of his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Full and
Exact Collation of about twenty Greek Manuscripts of the Gospels</span></span> [pp.
lxxiv. and 178,—1853], and the two prefatory chapters of his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Exact
Transcript of the Codex Augiensis</span></span>, &amp;c., to which is added a full Collation
of Fifty Manuscripts, [pp. lxxx. and 563,—1859,] to the attention of
students. His Collation of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Codex Bezæ</span></span> (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">d</span></span>) is perhaps the greatest of his
works: but whatever he has done, he has done best. It is instructive to
compare his collation of Cod. א with Tischendorf's. No reader of the
Greek Testament can afford to be without his reprint of Stephens' ed. of
1550: and English readers are reminded that Dr. Scrivener's is the only
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">classical</span></em> edition of the English Bible,—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The Cambridge Paragraph Bible</span></span>,
&amp;c., 1870-3. His Preface or <span class="tei tei-q">“Introduction”</span> (pp. ix.-cxx.) passes praise.
Ordinary English readers should enquire for his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Six Lectures on the Text

[1st] S. Mark (vi. 33) relates that on a certain occasion the multitude,
when they beheld our <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Saviour</span></span> and His Disciples departing in order to
cross over unto the other side of the lake, ran on foot thither,—(α) <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">and
outwent them</span></em>—(β) <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">and came together unto Him</span></em>”</span> (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> on His stepping out
of the boat: not, as Dr. Hort strangely imagines [p. 99], on His emerging
from the scene of His <span class="tei tei-q">“retirement”</span> in <span class="tei tei-q">“some sequestered nook”</span>).
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Now here, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a</span></span> substitutes συνέδραμον [<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">sic</span></span>] for συνῆλθον.—א <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b</span></span> with the
Coptic and the Vulg. omit clause (β).—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">d</span></span> omits clause (α), but substitutes
<span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">there</span></em>”</span> (αὐτοῦ) for <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">unto Him</span></em>”</span> in clause (β),—exhibits therefore a
fabricated text.—The Syriac condenses the two clauses thus:—<span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">got there

from all the rest and from one another. The present is, in fact, one of
those many places in S. Mark's Gospel where all is contradiction in those
depraved witnesses which Lachmann made it his business to bring into
fashion. Of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Confusion</span></em> there is plenty. <span class="tei tei-q">“Conflation”</span>—as the Reader
sees—there is none.

[2nd] In S. Mark viii. 26, our <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Saviour</span></span> (after restoring sight to the
blind man of Bethsaida) is related to have said,—(α) <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Neither enter into the
village</span></em>”</span>—(β) <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">nor tell it to any one</span></em>—(γ) <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in the village</span></em>.”</span> (And let it be

But it is found that the <span class="tei tei-q">“two false witnesses”</span> (א <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b</span></span>) omit clauses (β) and

no one</span></em> [μηδενὶ εἴπῃς, from Matth. viii. 4,] <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in the village</span></em>.”</span> Six copies of

paraphrase of the entire place:—<span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Depart unto thine house, and if thou
enterest into the village, tell it to no one.</span></em>”</span> The same reading exactly
is found in Evan. 13-69-346: 28, 61, 473, and i, (except that 28, 61,
346 exhibit <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">say nothing</span></em> [from Mk. i. 44] <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">to no one</span></em>.”</span>) All six however
add at the end,—<span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">not even in the village</span></em>.”</span> Evan. 124 and a stand alone in
exhibiting,—<span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Depart unto thine house; and enter not into the village;
neither tell it to any one</span></em>,”</span>—to which 124 [not a] adds,—<span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in the
village</span></em>.”</span>... <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Why</span></em> all this contradiction and confusion is now to be
called <span class="tei tei-q">“Conflation,”</span>—and what <span class="tei tei-q">“clear evidence”</span> is to be elicited therefrom
that <span class="tei tei-q">“Syrian”</span> are posterior alike to <span class="tei tei-q">“Western”</span> and to <span class="tei tei-q">“neutral”</span> readings,—passes
our powers of comprehension.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We shall be content to hasten forward when we have further informed
our Readers that while Lachmann and Tregelles abide by the Received
Text in this place; Tischendorf, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">alone of Editors</span></em>, adopts the reading of
א (μη εις την κωμην εισελθης): while Westcott and Hort, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">alone of Editors</span></em>,
adopt the reading of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b</span></span> (μηδε εις την κωμην εισελθης),—so ending the
sentence. What else however but calamitous is it to find that Westcott
and Hort have persuaded their fellow Revisers to adopt the same mutilated
exhibition of the Sacred Text? The consequence is, that henceforth,—instead
of <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Neither go into the town, nor tell it to any in the town</span></em>,”</span>—we
are invited to read, <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Do not even enter into the village</span></em>.”</span>

But such an ordinary circumstance as the omission of half-a-dozen

<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in Italy</span></em>,—the birthplace of the Sinaitic was [<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">not</span></em> Egypt, but] <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">either
Palestine or Syria</span></em>. Thus, considerations of time and place effectually
dispose of Tischendorf's preposterous notion that the Scribe of Codex <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b</span></span>
wrote <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">six leaves</span></em> of א: an imagination which solely resulted from the
anxiety of the Critic to secure for his own cod. א the same antiquity
which is claimed for the vaunted cod. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b</span></span>.

notion that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the last verse</span></em> of S. John's Gospel in א was not written by the
same hand which wrote the rest of the Gospel. There is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">no manner of

preliminary to writing that last verse, and executing the curious and

into the things he hath not seen</span></em>”</span>); where א* <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a b d</span></span>* and a little handful of
suspicious documents leave out the <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">not</span></em>.”</span> Our Editors, rather than recognize
this blunder (so obvious and ordinary!), are for conjecturing Α
ΕΟΡΑΚΕΝ ΕΜΒΑΤΕΥΩΝ into ΑΕΡΑ ΚΕΝΕΜΒΑΤΕΥΩΝ; which (if
it means anything at all) may as well mean,—<span class="tei tei-q">“proceeding on an airy
foundation to offer an empty conjecture.”</span> Dismissing that conjecture as
worthless, we have to set off the whole mass of the copies—against some
6 or 7:—Irenæus (i. 847), Theodoras Mops, (in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">loc</span></span>.), Chrys. (xi. 372),
Theodoret (iii. 489, 490), John Damascene (ii. 211)—against no Fathers
at all (for Origen once has μή [iv. 665]; once, has it not [iii. 63]; and
once is doubtful [i. 583]). Jerome and Augustine both take notice of the
diversity of reading, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">but only to reject it</span></em>.—The Syriac versions, the Vulgate,
Gothic, Georgian, Sclavonic, Æthiopic, Arabic and Armenian—(we owe the
information, as usual, to Dr. Malan)—are to be set against the suspicious
Coptic. All these then are with the Traditional Text: which cannot
seriously be suspected of error.</dd><dt class="tei tei-notelabel"><a id="note_796" name="note_796" href="#noteref_796">796.</a></dt><dd class="tei tei-notetext">εὑρεθήσεται.</dd><dt class="tei tei-notelabel"><a id="note_797" name="note_797" href="#noteref_797">797.</a></dt><dd class="tei tei-notetext">Augustin, vii. 595.</dd><dt class="tei tei-notelabel"><a id="note_798" name="note_798" href="#noteref_798">798.</a></dt><dd class="tei tei-notetext">ii. 467: iii. 865:—ii. 707: iii. 800:—ii. 901. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">In Luc</span></span>. pp. 428, 654.</dd><dt class="tei tei-notelabel"><a id="note_799" name="note_799" href="#noteref_799">799.</a></dt><dd class="tei tei-notetext">ii. 347.</dd><dt class="tei tei-notelabel"><a id="note_800" name="note_800" href="#noteref_800">800.</a></dt><dd class="tei tei-notetext">Preface to <span class="tei tei-q">“Provisional issue,”</span> p. xxi.</dd><dt class="tei tei-notelabel"><a id="note_801" name="note_801" href="#noteref_801">801.</a></dt><dd class="tei tei-notetext"><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Introduction</span></span>, p. 210.</dd><dt class="tei tei-notelabel"><a id="note_802" name="note_802" href="#noteref_802">802.</a></dt><dd class="tei tei-notetext"><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ibid</span></span>. p. 276.</dd><dt class="tei tei-notelabel"><a id="note_803" name="note_803" href="#noteref_803">803.</a></dt><dd class="tei tei-notetext">Apud Mai, vi. 105.</dd><dt class="tei tei-notelabel"><a id="note_804" name="note_804" href="#noteref_804">804.</a></dt><dd class="tei tei-notetext"><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Opp.</span></span> vii. 543.

Note, that Griesbach only mentions Gregory of Nyssa (whose name
Tregelles omits entirely) to remark that he is not to be cited for Θεός;
seeing that, according to him, 1 Tim. iii. 16 is to be read thus:—τὸ
μυστήριον ἐν σαρκὶ ἐφανερώθη. Griesbach borrowed that quotation and
that blunder from Wetstein; to be blindly followed in turn by Scholz
and Alford. And yet, the words in question are <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">not the words of Gregory
Nyss. at all</span></em>; but of Apolinaris, against whom Gregory is writing,—as

</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Against the respectability and personal worth of any member of the
Revisionist body, let me not be supposed to breathe a syllable. All,
(for aught I know to the contrary,) may be men of ability and attainment,
as well as of high moral excellence. I will add that, in early life, I
numbered several professing Unitarians among my friends. It were base
in me to forget how wondrous kind I found them: how much I loved
them: how fondly I cherish their memory.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Further. That in order to come at the truth of Scripture, we are
bound to seek help at the hands of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">any</span></em> who are able to render help,—<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">who</span></em>
ever doubted? If a worshipper of the false prophet,—if a devotee of
Buddha,—could contribute anything,—<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">who</span></em> would hesitate to sue to him
for enlightenment? As for Abraham's descendants,—they are our very
brethren.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But it is quite a different thing when Revisionists appointed by the
Convocation of the Southern Province, co-opt Separatists and even
Unitarians into their body, where they shall determine the sense of
Scripture and vote upon its translation on equal terms. Surely, when the
Lower House of Convocation accepted the 5th <span class="tei tei-q">“Resolution”</span> of the Upper
House,—viz., that the Revising body <span class="tei tei-q">“shall be at liberty to invite the
co-operation of any eminent for scholarship, to whatever nation or religious
body they may belong;”</span>—the Synod of Canterbury did not suppose that
it was pledging itself to sanction <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">such</span></em> <span class="tei tei-q">“co-operation”</span> as is implied by
actual <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">co-optation</span></em>!
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It should be added that Bp. Wilberforce, (the actual framer of the
5th fundamental Resolution,) has himself informed us that <span class="tei tei-q">“in framing
it, it never occurred to him that it would apply to the admission of any
member of the Socinian body.”</span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Chronicle of Convocation</span></span> (Feb. 1871,)

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“I am aware,”</span> (says our learned and pious bishop of Lincoln,) <span class="tei tei-q">“that the
ancient Church did not scruple to avail herself of the translation of a
renegade Jew, like Aquila; and of Ebionitish heretics, like Symmachus
and Theodotion; and that St. Augustine profited by the expository rules of
Tychonius the Donatist. But I very much doubt whether the ancient
Church would have looked for a large outpouring of a blessing from <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">God</span></span>
on a work of translating His Word, where the workmen were not all
joined together in a spirit of Christian unity, and in the profession of the
true Faith; and in which the opinions of the several translators were to
be counted and not weighed; and where everything was to be decided
by numerical majorities; and where the votes of an Arius or a Nestorius
were to be reckoned as of equal value with those of an Athanasius or
a Cyril.”</span> (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Address on the Revised Version</span></span>, 1881, pp. 38.)</p></dd><dt class="tei tei-notelabel"><a id="note_1130" name="note_1130" href="#noteref_1130">1130.</a></dt><dd class="tei tei-notetext"><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The Bible and Popular Theology</span></span>, by G.

Matth. (and S. Luke) iv. 3: in S. Mark
v. 43: viii. 7, and in many other places. On the other hand, the Revisers
have thrust <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">command</span></em>”</span> into S. Matth. xx. 21, where <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">grant</span></em>”</span> had far
better have been let alone: and have overlooked other places (as S. Matth.
xxii. 24, S. James ii. 11), where <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">command</span></em>”</span> might perhaps have been
introduced with advantage. (I nothing doubt that when the Centurion of
Capernaum said to our Lord μόνον εἰπὲ λόγῳ [Mtt. viii. 8 = Lu. vii. 7],
he entreated Him <span class="tei tei-q">“only to give <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the word of command</span></em>.”</span>)
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We all see, of course, that it was because Δός is rendered <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">grant</span></em>”</span> in
the (very nearly) parallel place to S. Matth. xx. 21 (viz. S. Mark x. 37),
that the Revisers thought it incumbent on them to represent Εἰπέ in the
earlier Gospel differently; and so they bethought themselves of <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">command</span></em>.”</span>
(Infelicitously enough, as I humbly think. <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Promise</span></em>”</span> would
evidently have been a preferable substitute: the word in the original
(εἰπεῖν) being one of that large family of Greek verbs which vary their
shade of signification according to their context.) But it is plainly
impracticable to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">level up</span></em> after this rigid fashion,—to translate in this
mechanical way. Far more is lost than is gained by this straining after
an impossible closeness of rendering. The spirit becomes inevitably
sacrificed to the letter. All this has been largely remarked upon above, at
pp. <a href="#Pg187" class="tei tei-ref">187-206</a>.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Take the case before us in illustration. S. James and S. John with
their Mother, have evidently agreed together to <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ask a favour</span></em>”</span> of their
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span></span> (cf. Mtt. xx. 20, Mk. x. 35). The Mother begins Εἰπέ,—the sons
begin, Δός. Why are we to assume that the request is made by the
Mother in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">a different spirit</span></em> from the sons? Why are we to impose upon
her language the imperious sentiment which the very mention of
<span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">command</span></em>”</span> unavoidably suggests to an English ear?
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A prior, and yet more fatal objection, remains in full force. The
Revisers, (I say it for the last time,) were clearly going beyond their
prescribed duty when they set about handling the Authorized Version
after this merciless fashion. Their business was to correct <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">plain and
